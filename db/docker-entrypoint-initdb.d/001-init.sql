The first session of UNEA-5 was be conducted virtually on 22-23 February 2021 with a revised and streamlined agenda that focused on urgent and procedural decisions. Substantive matters that require in-depth negotiations will be deferred to a resumed in-person session of UNEA-5 in February 2022 in a format to be defined and agreed on at a later stage.The overall theme of UNEA-5 was “Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals”.The theme called for strengthened action to protect and restore nature and the nature-based solutions to achieve the SDGs in its three complementary dimensions (social, economic and environmental). UNEA-5 provides Member States and stakeholders with a platform for sharing and implementing successful approaches that contribute to the achievement of the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, including the goals related to the eradication of poverty and sustainable patterns of consumption and production. UNEA-5 will also provide an opportunity for Member States and Stakeholders to take ambitious steps towards building back better and greener by ensuring that investments in economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to sustainable development.	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/event_004.png	global	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.440427+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.440427+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

However, the First World Ocean Assessment released in 2016 found that much of the ocean is now seriously degraded, with changes and losses in the structure, function and benefits from marine systems.In addition, the impact of multiple stressors on the ocean is projected to increase as the human population grows towards the expected 9 billion by 2050.Adaptation strategies and science-informed policy responses to global change are urgently needed.Scientific understanding of the oceans responses to pressures and management action is fundamental for sustainable development. Ocean observations and research are also essential to predict the consequences of change, design mitigation and guide adaptation.As mandated by the UN General Assembly, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO will coordinate the Decades preparatory process, inviting the global ocean community to plan for the next ten years in ocean science and technology to deliver, together, the ocean we need for the future we want!	\N	global	UNESCO	2021-04-05 07:08:09.452246+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.452246+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

The world has united around the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: all countries and all stakeholders pledged that no one will be left behind and determined to ensure that every human being can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment.A decade of concerted global action on Healthy Ageing is urgently needed. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the seriousness of existing gaps in policies, systems and services. Already, there are more than 1 billion people aged 60 years or older, with most living in low- and middle-income countries. Many do not have access to even the basic resources necessary for a life of meaning and of dignity. Many others confront multiple barriers that prevent their full participation in society.	\N	global	WHO	2021-04-05 07:08:09.463025+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.463025+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

When first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, 29 December (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity), was designated The International Day for Biological Diversity. In December 2000, the UN General Assembly adopted 22 May as IDB, to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on 22 May 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This was partly done because it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of 29 December, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year.	\N	global	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.535707+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.535707+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N
14	EU Green Week	2021-05-24 00:00:00+00	2021-06-04 00:00:00+00	Pollution affects everybody – through the air we breathe, the water we drink or the land we grow our food on. It is the largest environmental cause of multiple mental and physical diseases, and of premature deaths, especially among children, people with certain medical conditions and the elderly. But pollution does not affect everybody equally. People who live in more deprived areas very often live close to contaminated sites or in areas where there is a very high flow of traffic. Pollution is also one of the main reasons for the loss of biodiversity. It reduces the ability of ecosystems to provide services such as carbon sequestration and decontamination.But it can be prevented. The EU Action Plan toward a Zero Pollution Ambition is a key action of the European Green Deal scheduled for spring 2021. It will help to create a toxic-free environment across the EU by better monitoring and, reporting, and by preventing and remedying pollution from air, water, soil, and consumer products.It will also support the post-COVID 19 recovery by helping to rebuild a more sustainable EU economy, creating job opportunities and reducing social inequalities. The European Green Week 2021 will be dedicated to the zero pollution ambition. It will also look at other relevant European Green Deal initiatives, such the climate initiatives, the upcoming Chemicals Strategy, as well as initiatives in the field of energy, industry, mobility, agriculture, fisheries, health and biodiversity.EU Green Week 2021 will be an opportunity to engage with all stakeholders and interested citizens on how we can work together to make the ambition for a zero pollution and toxic-free environment a reality.	\N	transnational	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.544024+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.544024+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

Increasingly, however, the health of the ocean is intimately tied to our health. Some may be surprised to read that organisms discovered at extreme depths are used to speed up the detection of COVID-19, and probably even more to learn that, it is the environment that could give a solution to humankind.This is one of the multiple reasons why we should celebrate World Oceans Day: to remind everyone of the major role the oceans have in everyday life. They are the lungs of our planet, providing most of the oxygen we breathe. The purpose of the Day is to inform the public of the impact of human actions on the ocean, develop a worldwide movement of citizens for the ocean, and mobilize and unite the worlds population on a project for the sustainable management of the world's oceans. They are a major source of food and medicine and a critical part of the biosphere.

It highlights the many values of our rivers, strives to increase public awareness, and encourages the improved stewardship of all rivers around the world.  Rivers in virtually every country face an array of threats, and only through our active involvement can we ensure their health in the years ahead.In 2005, the United Nations launched the Water for Life Decade to help create a greater awareness of the need to better care for our water resources. Following this, the establishment of World Rivers Day was in response to a proposal initiated by internationally renowned river advocate, Mark Angelo.The proposal for a  global event to celebrate rivers was based on the success of BC Rivers Day, which Mark Angelo had founded and led in western Canada since 1980.  A World Rivers Day event was seen by agencies of the UN as a good fit for the aims of the Water for Life Decade and the proposal was approved.  River enthusiasts from around the world came together to organize the inaugural WRD event.  That first event in 2005 was a great success and Rivers Day was celebrated across dozens of countries.  Since then, the event has continued to grow.  It is annually celebrated on the fourth Sunday of every September.  Last year, several million people in up to 100 countries celebrated the many values of our waterways.	\N	global	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.631734+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.631734+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

Shipping has continued to transport more than 80% of world trade, including vital medical supplies, food and other basic goods that are critical for the COVID-19 response and recovery – but hundreds of thousands of seafarers face a humanitarian crisis as they have been stranded at sea, unable to get off the ships they operate with contracts extended by many months. This needs to be addressed urgently, through Governments designating seafarers as essential workers and ensuring safe crew changes can take place.2021 Theme: Seafarers at the core of shippings futureThe theme for this year reflects a clear need to raise awareness of seafarersʹ crucial role in world trade and increase their visibility. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the crew change crisis in 2020 has highlighted seafarersʹ exceptional contribution as key and essential workers on the front line of delivering vital goods through a pandemic and in ordinary times. The international community has seen how the ability for shipping services and seafarers to ensure the functioning of the global supply chains has been central to responding to, and eventually overcoming, this pandemic. This could not happen without the professionalism and dedication of the worlds seafarers.The World Maritime theme for 2021 will provide the opportunity to focus on seafarers as the people at the heart of shipping, while also allowing for activities to delve into specific topics relevant to the role of the seafarer in safety, maritime security, environmental protection and seafarersʹ well-being; and the future of seafaring against a backdrop of increased digitalization and automation. The theme also links to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4 on education and training; SDG 8 related to decent work; SDG 9 on innovation and industry, which links to the promotion of a resilient maritime sector; and SDG 5 on gender equality, linked to efforts to promote seafaring as a career for all, including women, in particular.	\N	global	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.639778+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.639778+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

39	Achieving a plastic-free ocean for Limbe, Cameroon	2021-08-06 00:00:00+00	2021-08-06 00:00:00+00	The overall goal of the project is to enhance environmental management of the coastal areas of Cameroon by minimizing the plastic and waste litter in these areas. Indiscriminate dumping of plastics and other waste is rampant in the South West coastal region and of particular interest, the principal coastline of Ngeme-Batoke. The area is home to sensitive ecosystems, critically endangered species, endangered bird species, and other species listed as Vulnerable by IUCN. This area is also greatly dependent on tourism to sustain its local economy and it is therefore vital to ensure that efforts are taken to preserve its natural ecosystem from the menace of plastic pollution. Our aim is to change the behaviors of local communities that contribute significantly to this problem by embarking on an Awareness Educational Campaign about maintaining a clean coastline through a Beach Cleanup. This project will engage 300 volunteers.ASCOA has been bringing together passionate ocean lovers and helping them contribute to a vision for trash free seas in Cameroon. ASCOA aims to prevent trash from entering the waters by working with everyone from individuals to businesses to change the products, practices and behaviors that lead to ocean trash. It is intended to carry out regular and effective activities to maintain Cameroons beaches clean and trash-free by carrying out a varied approach, to solve the problem in the long run. Waste bins will be installed and awareness campaigns will be conducted to reduce littering in the long run. ASCOA intends to organize beach cleanup during world Ocean day 8 June 2021.	\N	\N	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:09.85861+00	2021-04-05 07:08:09.85861+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N

Others have worked on the role of packaging.\nThe Ocean Foundation will pursue science-informed national legislation in plastic-producing countries to require reengineering of the chemistry of plastic itself, redesigning of plastic products, and limiting what is made from plastic.

The Clean Europe Network is currently developing two litter monitoring systems. One methodology monitors and measures litter, littering and litter items on land, having been tested in a pilot-programme involving 10 European countries in 2016. While for the second system a pre-pilot scheme was set up last year, run on 4 locations in 4 EU countries. It monitors land based litter sources into fresh water pathways, which eventually carry litter items to the ocean. Both methodologies aim to assist local authorities or individuals to assess, monitor, measure and reduce local litter occurrences or litter sources, while, if used on a greater scale, producing comprehensive and comparable data on an European level. However, though these two monitoring systems in development current purpose focus on the EU, they could in due course be adapted and used in other parts of the world. The Clean Europe Network hopes to share this experience and expertise in the future. We anticipate to learn from the experiences of other parties by participating in the GPML and hope to be able to contribute with the experience and knowledge, which the 16 litter prevention organisations, making up the Clean Europe Network, could bring to this project.

144	Kystlotteriet	\N	Non-governmental organization	171	regional	Beach and coastal clean-up	Focal area A and B We at Kystlotteriet are very interested in joining the Global Partnership on Marine Litter. Kystlotteriet is a project, currently under the framework of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, but in the process of becoming its own organization. Our focus area is to provide infrastructure and incentives for on-going voluntary coastal clean-up trough an innovative lottery model. The project is based on cooperation between multiple stakeholders working together to save the ocean from marine litter. Local and national businesses donate prizes, local governments provide (voluntary) funding as well as designated pick up and drop off spots for gear and litter, volunteers pick litter along the coast and join in the lottery for the chance to win prizes in local and national drawings. Through our cooperation with local actors we can guarantee permanent access to gear (garbage bags, gloves etc..) and we make sure that the garbage is being picked up by local renovation companies. What Kystlotteriet is doing is essentially lowering the threshold for voluntary action, ensuring that anyone can contribute to an important cause and in that way building a culture of ownership to nature. In addition to serving as a permanent infrastructure for volunteers wishing to contribute to cleaning up the shoreline, we at Kystlotteriet organize clean-up events where we provide transportation by either buss or boat, clean-up gear, guidance as well as food and drinks. Our organization is growing fast and we are currently anchored in 50 Norwegian and 4 Danish municipalities, organizing over 30 clean-up events during the summer of 2018. One garbage-bag equals one lottery ticket, during 2017 we had over 6000 tickets contributing to removing 40 tones of marine litter from our shoreline.

Focal area A Our project is based on synergies whose objective is to create new ways of thinking, by raising awareness to tackle the problem at source: it means reducing quantities of plastic produced and recycling or recovering our waste in order to preserve our resources. Plastic Odyssey is the name of our ship that will set sail in 2020 aiming the most polluted coasts of the world. Plastic waste will be collected on the beaches, at the shore and in the surrounding towns and transformed into materials and objects for local use (slabs, bricks, etc.), through the use of low cost technologies embarked on the boat. Non recyclable plastic waste will be oriented towards energy production. The process used is pyrolysis to convert plastic into fuel to power the boat. The vessel will be a complete floating workshop integrating sorting, recycling and energy recovery technologies. Based on short loops, Plastic Odyssey is also a model of cooperation that aims at making local people aware of the value of plastic waste: turning waste into a resource by leaning on local waste pickers, micro-entreprise of recycling, ragmen … and allowing the professionalisation of informal sector through low technologies free of patent, easy to build, and durably used by local entrepreneurs and artisans. The embarked workshop is made of these technologies and the boat aims to spread them around the world.	Marine litter	APPROVED	\N

During the project the ordinances banning plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic bottles (PET) and \nfoam in the municipality of Roatán were approved. BICA began its citizen science program in 2018, consisting of a \ndrift card study and brand audits in community beaches around the island of Roatan to collect data on waste.  \nThis data was very valuable for the local municipality in 2019 when the bans came into effect.  \nIt was clear the majority of waste collected during the brand audits was plastic, 36% collected being PET bottles \nand 16% collected the tops of bottles.\nIn 2020, BICA started a research in microplastic in the digestive system of lionfish which is still going on and, \nit will continue in animals found beached and commercial fish caught by artesanal fishermen.

The project will initiate waste sorting and recycling activities in the capital Yerevan and select village communities,  foster new business opportunities in the waste management industry,  increase public awareness of recycling and reuse,  promote environmental education. Through the SGP grant funding,  ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools,  universities,  organizations,  companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic,  paper,  glass,  and metallic waste,  which will be transported to the recycling sites.  The project aims to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting the recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to the reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air,  water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover,  the project will hold different competitions,  training and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about the adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.slaq.am/arm/news/1262611/	\N

The project initiated construction of a new waste sorting and recycling plant to be located on the territory of Dashtaqar landfill.  The project is envisaged to be implemented in the following two stages: (i) construction of waste sorting facility that will ensure separation of organic and non-organic fractions with subsequent sorting of non-organic materials and separation of plastic,  metals,  glass,  textile,  paper,  etc and (ii) construction of organic waste processing facility that will produce biogas or organic fertilizers for agricultural needs. This model of sustainable,  environmentally safe and financially feasible community-led solid waste management system that operates based on waste reduction principle has a great replication and scaling-up potential.	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://bit.ly/340HRHJ	\N

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions,  in particular plastics,  and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment,  by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  *\tThe project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo,  CHU JRB Befelatanana,  currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  *\tThe project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious,  rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs,  including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam,  and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  *\tThe project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company,  Waste Master (Z),  currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka,  University Teaching Hospital (UTH),  Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).  *\tIn Zambia,  the project also initiated a demonstration activity,  as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste,  on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka,  but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N

This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during fishing,  and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO,  dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split,  one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands,  Denmark,  Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs,  such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland.	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.defishgear.net/desert2/itemlist/tag/fishing%20for%20litter	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/activity_545728-545719-53853866.jpg

Considering waste management systems in the region remain largely inadequate to process increasing amounts of plastic waste,  the project focuses on the lifecycle stages of (i) Production of plastic products,  (ii) Plastic use,  and (iii) Collection / sorting / recycling,  to ensure that less plastic is wasted and strategically prevent plastic litter entering the ocean. To achieve these objectives,  project partners include national and local government agencies; businesses,  producers,  retailers,  and associations in the packaging,  consumer and institutional products industry. To promote inclusive whole-of-value-chain planning at the national and regional level,  project activities will actively engage civil society,  consumers,  informal waste workers,  and communities most vulnerable to the impacts of marine litter.	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.sea-circular.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/About-SEA-circular-1.pdf	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/activity_545728-545719-54510309.png

By overlaying GIS data the study was able to investigate potential correlations and analyse various environmental,  health,  and demographic data to evaluate issues of poverty and gender as they may be related to incidence of disease and risk. This study revealed that there was a relationship between the cases of ZikV and marine debris density,  especially of large marine debris (i.e. tires).

In partnership with cities,  the private sector,  informal waste worker cooperatives and regional thought leaders,  ESCAP encourages more sustainable consumption practices to return plastic resources to the production cycle; reduce plastic waste leakage into the environment and the oceans; and helps contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ESCAP provides a vital role in supporting capacity building initiatives with local and national governments to promote more circular waste economies.     The project developed and applied an assessment of plastic waste value chains to identify where different actors’ contributions intersect and several potential leakages of plastic waste that contribute to marine litter debris in partnership with waste cooperatives and local governments as well as the Stockholm Environment Institute,  Asia Centre.

During this short time,  the initiative has drawn national and international attention to the Tisza; activated thousands of volunteers; and has removed 120 tonnes of plastic and other sorts of contamination from the river. It has started as a trash-boat race,  with the simple goal of collecting as many plastics from the river as possible. The best boat was given a fancy award made of recycled plastic: the PLASTIC Cup (hence the name,  after one of the world's most prestigious boat races - the America's Cup). By now PLASTIC Cup has become an ongoing,  all-year-round series of events. Awareness raising campaigns,  exhibitions,  movie screenings,  public talks and clean-up actions make the volunteers busy. Experts,  researchers have joined the project and so the systematic monitoring of the plastic contamination started. In the meantime,  the good old boat race has not been forgotten. On the contrary,  it's more popular than ever before. Implementation is carried out on 3 levels.     ●\tCLEANUPS ON LAND. Team building exercises,  small and large scale foodplain forest cleanups all year around for all age groups.  ●\tCLEANUP ACTIONS ON WATER. Short and long distance boat races,  large scale interventions accomplished in cooperation with water authorities,  companies and local settlements.  ●\tINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. Educational,  fundraising and awareness raising campaigns in upstream countries in order to reduce and wherever possible,  stop the pollution.  	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.facebook.com/petkupa	\N

In addition,  it aims to contribute to the overall objective of developing a policy framework and educating conscious citizens who are well aware of plastic pollution consequences and are motivated to act adequately. During the project,  6000 consumers of Tsiran Supermarket (official project partner) will be provided with material tote bags and offered different incentives such as cash bonuses on their loyalty cards and/or special gifts if they replace single-use plastic bags with material ones. For this,  the Supermarket has allocated a budget of around $15, 000 for the duration of the experiment and expressed readiness to increase it for further phases of the project.

53	6	\N	The ”G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter” was adopted at the G20 Hamburg Summit in 2017 and laid the foundation for the G20 members to address marine litter, the “G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastics Litter” facilitates further concrete actions on marine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, in line with the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter, while taking into account our own appropriate policies, approaches, and national circumstances, on a voluntary basis. This framework is expected to complement the work of the UNEP. To facilitate effective implementation of the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter and to encourage voluntary actions by the G20 members in accordance with national policies, approaches, and circumstances, members share and continuously update information on actions and progress on marine litter. This page highlights the information shared by the government of India.

231	27	\N	The objective of the national roadmaps development has been to provide a strategic plan of  actionable goals and activities for achieving a low carbon,  resource-efficient tourism  sector in the Philippines,  the Dominican Republic,  Mauritius and Saint Lucia.  A long-list of solutions has enabled the identification of hotspots,  and resource efficiency  indicators which were validated via the STAG and used as a key input for the identification  of priorities and development of the roadmaps and country action plans.  A series of workshops was organized to prioritize solutions and develop the roadmaps and  specifically,  to discuss feasibility,  and identify key stakeholders for synergies. Several steps  were taken to refine the shortlisted solutions,  such as in-country workshops and steering  committee meetings.  The project team worked with tourism stakeholders in the countries to identify  and develop three systemic solutions to address priority environmental impact hotspots  and develop the roadmap over an 18-month period.     https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/country-roadmaps

The program’s goal is to help those companies reduce occasional plastic pellets,  flakes and powder loss to the marine environment.   The program basis is the Manual of Pellets Zero Program - OCS®,  adapted to the Brazilian reality. The Manual seeks to reach the goals set by Sustainable Development Goal #14 (SDG-14) related to the conservation and sustainable use of oceans as well as the ones committed by the governments of various countries and by civil society international organizations during the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2017.

532	62	\N	The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment (NPEGC) was launched at the Our Oceans Conference in Bali (Indonesia) on 29th October 2018. Led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UNEP,  the Global Commitment brings together and aligns the efforts of businesses,  governments,  and other organisations behind a common vision and targets,  to address plastic waste and pollution at its source. The Global Commitment aims to act as a lighthouse by suggesting specific actions designed with a systemic perspective for each actor in the plastics value chain,  enabling frontrunning businesses and governments to inspire others and lead by example. UNEP leads the engagement of governments under this Initiative. As of October 2019,  over 400 institutions have signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment,  including 19 governments from around the world,  and more than 200 businesses of the plastic packaging value chain (jointly representing over 20% of all plastic packaging used globally).

533	62	\N	The actions proposed in the Global Commitment were co-designed by UNEP and EMF based on the sustainable consumption and production,  systemic approach to plastics,  promoted by UNEP. And UNEP is leading the engagement with government signatories under the Global Commitment.
534	62	\N	Signatories of the Global Commitment (governments at all levels; businesses in each step of the value chain of plastics,  e.g. including plastic producers,  manufacturers of fast moving consumer goods,  hospitality sector,  recyclers… and also financial institutions) take actions to meet their commitments and report annually their progress made against their commitments. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is leading the engagement with business signatories under the Global Commitment and UNEP is leading the engagement with government signatories.
535	62	\N	The latest list of signatories can be found here,  including companies,  governments and relevant organisations operating in many countries: https://www.newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/Global-Commitment-Signatories-October-2019.pdf (For the list of governments see page 5 of the document)
536	62	\N	The Global Commitment focuses on the plastic value chain rather than specific place or area. Actions taken by signatories along the value chain will reduce plastic pollution including marine plastic pollution and thus reduce associated negative impacts.

565	68	\N	UNEP,  EMF,  Ocean Conservancy and GRID Arendal collaborated under a GEF-funded project “Addressing Marine Plastics - A Systemic Approach” (2017-2019). The project aimed at capitalizing on growing a baseline of knowledge on marine plastics sources,  pathways and environmental impacts,  to recommend actions to build circularity and reduce pollution for the plastic sector. Under this project,  a roadmap to circular economy for plastics was developed by UNEP in collaboration with partners. UNEP also developed a report to take stock of the extent of knowledge on plastics in marine environment,  a global plastic value chain mapping report and a to-be-published recommendations for action report. 2 multi-stakeholder consultation workshops were held by UNEP to map the plastic value chain and identify recommended actions towards a circular economy for plastics. 
566	68	\N	See URL section
567	68	\N	Recommended actions proposed by UNEP to address marine plastics under this project need to be implemented by all relevant stakeholders,  including governments,  business,  NGOs,  academia and financial sector,  etc.
568	68	\N	The project is at global level and UNEP's deliverables under this project are focusing on global plastic value chain instead of a specific country.

860	97	\N	"The main objective of the ""RecycleIt"" initiative is to promote the formation of waste separation and recycling culture in Armenia by installing waste sorting bins and raising awareness on waste management. The project will initiate waste sorting and recycling activities in the capital Yerevan and select village communities,  foster new business opportunities in the waste management industry,  increase public awareness of recycling and reuse,  promote environmental education. Through the SGP grant funding,  ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools,  universities,  organizations,  companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic,  paper,  glass,  and metallic waste,  which will be transported to the recycling sites.  The project aims to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting the recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to the reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air,  water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover,  the project will hold different competitions,  training and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about the adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.

1056	121	\N	The project aims to reduce or eliminate (to the extent possible) the environmental and human health risks associated with the operation of the existing municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal site located in Dashtaqar community of the Ararat region,   via construction and operation of the waste sorting and recycling facility. The project initiated construction of a new waste sorting and recycling plant to be located on the territory of Dashtaqar landfill.  The project is envisaged to be implemented in the following two stages: (i) construction of waste sorting facility that will ensure separation of organic and non-organic fractions with subsequent sorting of non-organic materials and separation of plastic,  metals,  glass,  textile,  paper,  etc and (ii) construction of organic waste processing facility that will produce biogas or organic fertilizers for agricultural needs. This model of sustainable,  environmentally safe and financially feasible community-led solid waste management system that operates based on waste reduction principle has a great replication and scaling-up potential.

1083	124	\N	The project focuses on the healthcare sector in selected Sub-Saharan African countries and aims to reduce the emission of UPOPs as well as Mercury releases. The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions,  in particular plastics,  and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment,  by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  *\tThe project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo,  CHU JRB Befelatanana,  currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  *\tThe project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious,  rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs,  including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam,  and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  *\tThe project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company,  Waste Master (Z),  currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka,  University Teaching Hospital (UTH),  Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).  *\tIn Zambia,  the project also initiated a demonstration activity,  as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste,  on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka,  but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.

1262	141	\N	National Geographic Society (NGS) developed an RFP titled “Reducing Ocean Plastic Pollution”,  which aimed to measurably reduce the flow of marine plastic litter into our oceans. Projects could focus on using science to inform and advance national/subnational policies or management plans,  or on implementing innovative behavior change approaches with the potential to inspire large numbers of people to dramatically reduce their consumption of single-use plastics or adopt better recycling/reuse behaviors.

1274	142	\N	The Ocean Plastics Charter (the Charter) is the only global framework to take a resource-efficient lifecycle management approach to plastic waste. By bringing together leading governments,  businesses and civil society organizations,  the Charter lays the groundwork to ensure plastics are designed for reuse and recycling,  and commits signatories to supporting its objectives and achieving plastics stewardship on land and at sea.
1275	142	\N	The Ocean Plastics Charter (the Charter) sets out a number of commitments according to five categories: 1) Sustainable design,  production and after-use markets; 2) Collection,  management and other systems and infrastructure; 3) Sustainable lifestyles and education; 4) Research,  innovation and new technologies; and,  5) Coastal and shoreline action. The quantitative and time bound targets found within these categories,  as outlined in the Charter,  represent ambitious guidelines and voluntary commitments that will support partners’ achievement of the broader objectives of the Charter,  which contribute to Sustainable Development Goals 12 and 14 of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Agenda.

1323	147	\N	Since the River Ganga is one of the 10 rivers responsible for around 90 percent of the plastic that ends up at sea,  the India Water Foundation (IWF) undertook on its own,  the task of educating and spreading awareness in the village community regarding the ills of using plastics and further on how it is polluting the river and later oceans. We took the holistic understanding of these Ganga Grams (villages on the bank of River Ganga) in the blocks of Hastinapur and Parikshitgarh of district Meerut in state Uttar Pradesh. These villages are close to Ganga river and major polluters for Ganga river. The District Administration was instrumental in supporting our program with their insights and experiences.

1391	155	\N	Fishing for Litter
1392	155	\N	Fisheries is a sector that can make a significant contribution to solving the problem of marine litter,  by participating in its removal through the "Fishing for Litter" (FfL) initiative. This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during fishing,  and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO,  dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split,  one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands,  Denmark,  Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs,  such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland.

Marine pollution,  especially in the form of plastic,  stood out as one of the main issues. Nevertheless,  civil society (especially the youth) voiced their enthusiasm to transition towards a plastic-free circular economy. The private sector showed evidence of their innovation and incorporation of science to provide sustainable alternatives to plastic. Academics,  civil society and governmental organizations presented factual case studies exposing the problems related to marine pollution and highlighting solutions.

1686	186	\N	In collaboration with IUCN,  UNEP (and the Life Cycle Initiative) is developing a national guidance on plastic pollution hotspotting and shaping action,  to support countries in:  1) Identifying HOTSPOTS related to the most relevant plastic polymers,  products,  and pathways leaking into the environment and their suspected impacts;  2) Considering key areas of INTERVENTION specific to the local context and enabling the mitigation of the hotspots;  3) Converging with key stakeholders on the best INSTRUMENTS to carry out the action.  The national guidance report will be published in early 2020 and the methodology is planned be piloted by UNEP and IUCN in countries and cities in 2019-2020,  including Cyprus,  Kenya,  Mauritius,  Menorca (Spain),  Mozambique,  Sao Paulo (Brazil),  South Africa,  Thailand and Vietnam. Currently the piloting is ongoing in Thailand and Vietnam.  
1687	186	\N	Guidance to help countries analyze hotspots along plastic value chain and identify actions to address identified hotspots
1688	186	\N	The national guidance report will be published in early 2020 and will be freely available and open source
1689	186	\N	It can be applied at national or sub-national level by countries/cities with needs.
1690	186	\N	Subject to data availability,  sector-related hotspots will be identified if the sector is with high amount of plastic leakage and/or associated impacts. Recommended actions to address those sectoral hotspots will be proposed as part of the outputs of the guidance piloting. Thus which sectors to be focused on depend on data availability,  amount of leakage and associated impacts from the leakage in relevant sectors.

1728	190	\N	The ”G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter” was adopted at the G20 Hamburg Summit in 2017 and laid the foundation for the G20 members to address marine litter, the “G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastics Litter” facilitates further concrete actions on marine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, in line with the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter, while taking into account our own appropriate policies, approaches, and national circumstances, on a voluntary basis. This framework is expected to complement the work of the UNEP. To facilitate effective implementation of the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter and to encourage voluntary actions by the G20 members in accordance with national policies, approaches, and circumstances, members share and continuously update information on actions and progress on marine litter. This page highlights the information shared by the government of Australia.

The aim is to remove litter from the environment,  raise awareness and collect data through citizen science. Volunteer clean-ups are very popular in Norway,  and over 110 000 volunteers took part in cleanup actions in 2019 either during the Coastal Cleanup Week,  during Before the Birds Return,  as part of KNB's Keep the Autumn Beautiful or in other local or regional activities. Volunteers are encouraged to clean up litter both along the coast and along rivers and lakes. The data registered by the volunteers is Norway's main source of data on marine litter.

1926	208	\N	The project aims to reduce the adverse impact of land-based plastic leakage into the marine environment,  by ensuring that less plastic is wasted at source and management of the plastic value chain is improved,  in South-East Asia. Considering waste management systems in the region remain largely inadequate to process increasing amounts of plastic waste,  the project focuses on the lifecycle stages of (i) Production of plastic products,  (ii) Plastic use,  and (iii) Collection / sorting / recycling,  to ensure that less plastic is wasted and strategically prevent plastic litter entering the ocean. To achieve these objectives,  project partners include national and local government agencies; businesses,  producers,  retailers,  and associations in the packaging,  consumer and institutional products industry. To promote inclusive whole-of-value-chain planning at the national and regional level,  project activities will actively engage civil society,  consumers,  informal waste workers,  and communities most vulnerable to the impacts of marine litter.

1938	209	\N	The “Sea to Source: Ganges” river expeditions mobilize a global community of experts to help tackle the global problem of plastic pollution. During the expeditions,  the team measures pre-monsoon and post-monsoon plastic pollution levels in the Ganges river and surrounding communities,  and conducts interviews,  solution workshops,  and education sessions at each site. Using the data they collect,  the team will work with local and national partners to inform solutions,  fill knowledge gaps,  and help drive a long-term positive change. The expedition (in partnership with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII),  the Indian Institute of Technology,  the University of Dhaka,  WildTeam Bangladesh,  and the Isabela Foundation) also focuses on documenting how plastic waste travels from source to sea and filling the critical knowledge gaps around plastic flow,  load,  and composition.

2125	228	\N	 “Plastics Sectoral Forum – For a Clean Ocean aims at raising society’s awareness of prevention and mitigation of litter entering oceans. The Forum works on the articulation among the sectors involved in production,  trading and assessment of the environmental impacts caused by marine litter. The accomplishment of these joint works,  as well as the stimulation to discussions on the matter along with the actors involved and among those sectors promote a better understanding of such issue.  In order to do so,  the partnership has narrowed the relationship with the Ministry of Environment by means of the Coastguard,  the Ministry of Industry,  Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC),  Brazil Navy and the Ministry of Environment National Plan Organizing Committee to Fight Against Marine Litter.  With actions involving different publics – population,  industries and public power – the forum has been acting with the aim to contribute to change the current scenario.

2166	234	\N	At its sixth meeting held in December 2002,  the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Basel Convention adopted the technical guidelines for the identification and environmentally sound management (ESM) of plastic wastes and for their disposal. At its fourteenth meeting held in May 2019,  in its decision BC-14/13,  the COP decided to update the technical guidelines on plastic waste and established a small intersessional working group. The group is led by China,  Japan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and consists of experts nominated by Parties and others. The group will prepare draft updated technical guidelines for consideration at the twelfth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel Convention to be held in June 2020. A further revised version will then be considered at the fifteenth meeting of the COP to be held in May 2021 for possible adoption. The technical guidelines include the following:  • Sources of plastic waste (pre-user and post-user)  • Environmentally sound and safe handling,  compaction,  transport,  storage and shipping of plastic waste  • Health and safety issues  • Fire safety  • Second life applications for plastics material  • Energy recovery from plastic waste  • Final disposal of plastic waste  • Technical guidelines on the environmentally sound management of plastic-coated cables scrap  
2167	234	\N	We are supporting parties and others,  to update the technical guidelines as the Secretariat of the Basel Convention and requested by the COP decision.

We try to rise ocean awareness through audiovisuals (diving,  marine life,  marine litter),  outdoor experiences (beach clean up and ecomurals),  and participatory stories,  encouraging kids to change plastic consumption habits,  be more familiar to ocean issues,  protect marine biodiversity,  and be Ocean Heroes.
2337	255	\N	Through beach clean-ups (picking up litter,  classifying and making a top 5 per site),  we try to enable kids to see for themselves and realize what is polluting their community,  and to get involved with solutions

2498	274	\N	The activity in it's entirety consisted of:  * Collecting plastic waste  * Sorting  * Filling with soil  * Growing trees.   This year,  we collected an estimated 90 tons of plastic litter in the Nkambe municipality and part of Misaje council area. These plastics consist mostly of whisky,  tomatoes and other plastic sachets below 60microns. They constitute the highest polluters in our communities given that it is cheap and accessible,  which are gradually turning our communities into plastic communities. The majority of them are transported by wind or streams for long distances. We were able to produce and plant 300.000 trees. To achieve this,  we got involved 60 youths in the chain from collection to sorting,  filling of sachets and planting of trees. Our next step is to generate enough funds from sales of trees to be able to acquire machines to recycle reused plastics to pavement bricks

2553	278	\N	Where rocks from tunnel production is disposed in water,  curtains are used to prevent silt from flowing into open waters and contaminating marine organisms. In this pilot we want to optimize the silt curtain as a silt barrier (in combination with boom),  and also check whether the curtain is effective as a barrier for microplastic from fuses etc. The solution will be fit for other,  similar scenarios as well.

2568	279	\N	The CLOCC (Clean Oceans through Clean Communities) Project intends to lead the development of waste management plans in communities where the potential to make a positive impact is high. This is done through first,  organizing and developing a training program for representatives from local authorities on how to set up a safe and professional solid waste management system.  Second,  through receiving assistance in the drafting and finalizing of local waste management plans.  And finally,  through the development of innovative ways of raising finance or investments from the private sector. One will be to assist developing sorting centers to develop financially sound business models and bankable projects,  the other will be in the form of co-investments with private investors (to reduce risk of their investments) and therefore attract more funding.

This has been actively promoted,  encouraging cooperation and collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders,  such as national,  local public organizations,  citizens,  NGOs,  businesses,  and research institutes. Plastics Smart promotes “the wise use of plastics” to prevent the generation of marine litter.   Clean Ocean Material Alliance: It has become necessary for society to promote worldwide efforts to overcome the marine plastic litter issue,  a newly emerging global challenge. To decrease such litter,  conducting appropriate control of waste is urgently needed,  including through thorough efforts for preventing littering,  further enhancement of the 3Rs (Reduce,  Reuse and Recycle) initiatives involving plastic products,  and further development and adoption of plastics with excellent biodegradability and materials alternative to plastics,  for e.g.,  paper.  We established the Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance consisting of a wide range of business operators that make up the supply chain and work actively in order to accelerate innovation through public-private partnerships by promoting the 3Rs new efforts and alternative materials that make the use of plastic products more sustainable.

2590	281	\N	The Baltic Sea Challenge (BSC) is a network initiative that invites organisations to commit in protecting the Baltic Sea and their local waters,  to building their own Baltic Sea Action Plan and to implementing it. In 2020 there are already about 300 member organisations in the BSC Network from the countries around the Baltic Sea. BSC is run by two big coastal cities in Finland,  Helsinki and Turku. In addition to inviting organizations to Baltic Sea protection work,  the cities themselves are committed to work for the Baltic Sea. The Joint Baltic Sea Action Plan of the cities of Helsinki and Turku 2019-2023 was published last year and it is the third of it's kind. Among the actions there some that especially target marine litter such as organizing annual beach cleaning events in collaborations with the cities of Tallinn and St. Petersburg and local actors. We are also organizing a round of agile experiments that aim to reduce the amount of plastic litter in and around the Baltic Sea.

2773	304	\N	This study mapped the incidence of mosquito borne public health concerns in the Caribbean to compare this with plastics consumption and to put the findings into the context of the zika virus. Puerto Rico was used to examine this relationship because the marine litter data was extensive and robust. By overlaying GIS data the study was able to investigate potential correlations and analyse various environmental,  health,  and demographic data to evaluate issues of poverty and gender as they may be related to incidence of disease and risk. This study revealed that there was a relationship between the cases of ZikV and marine debris density,  especially of large marine debris (i.e. tires). These results also suggest that coastal communities may want to prioritize the clean up of large marine debris to limit the habitat for Aedes aegypti habitat and subsequent ZikV transmission

2875	317	\N	An ongoing study gathering knowledge on the efficiency of using oil spill equipment to prevent plastic drifting to open water. Rock masses from tunnel production contains a large amount of plastic fuses and other waste. In a construction project where such masses are disposed in water,  we use a combination of oil boom and silt curtain to frame in the dump site,  we study the effect of the barrier and reveal needs for improvements to optimize the solution. The findings can also be transferred to other,  similar scenarios.

2901	319	\N	Transforming the tourism value chains to low carbon and resource efficiency requires an increase in sustainable consumption and production practices. By buying more sustainable products and services,  corporate buyers in the tourism sector can convey a strong market signal and help drive markets towards more sustainability. Following up the interactive workshop “Leveraging sustainable procurement practices to transform tourism value chains” which took place in October 2018,  UN Environment has documented successful sustainable procurement practices in a series of 16 case studies. They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics.

3051	335	\N	In May 2019,  Japan has formulated the "National Action Plan for Marine Plastic Litter." Focusing on how to prevent the outflow of plastic litter to the ocean.  This action plan lists effective countermeasures to realise a world without additional pollution by plastic.    Japan also formulated the "Resource Circulation Strategy for Plastics" with the purpose of comprehensively promoting plastic resource circulation. The main focus includes thorough reduction; effective,  efficient and sustainable recycling; promotion of recycled materials and bioplastics use; marine plastic countermeasures; international deployment; and infrastructure development.   In addtion,  based on the amendment of the  Act on Promoting the Treatment of Marine Debris on 2018,  Japan changed the "Basic Policy based on the Act on Promoting the Treatment of Marine Debris". The new basic policy defines treatment of marine debris based on the idea of "basin area" and includes measures against microplastics.

This bag can be used for fruits and vegetables on the market or for packaging products. But the most important factor is that this product is made using local labour and traditional knowledge from coastal communities,  who sew the net bag by hand. We develop the production chain and guarantee its origin and equity. The bag is then sold in our marketplace,  completely plastic-free.

A local orgnaisation called Bado Society for the Environment was supported by the UNICEF youth programme in Zwara,  to conduct a two day campaign with activities involving 250 children,  adolescents and young people.  They were introduced to the hazards of plastic,  collected all the  plastic they could collect,  from the coast and to a certain depth in the water,  conducted interactive entertainment activities that raise the awareness on the effects of plastic on marine life,  led a competition with prizes,  and distributed tokens to all participating children and adolescents. many musicals were involved.  Kids and families were informed about the difference between plastic and its derivatives and other left overs.  In terms of the impact on marine life. the collected plastic was donated to an organisation that works with challenged people in the same city. This organisation (called Latyasoue) collects plastic and sells it to a private company for recycling and they used the money  to support purchasing wheelchairs

3176	346	\N	Arising from the increasing concern about plastic waste contaminating the natural environment in Asia and the Pacific,  ESCAP brings together city actors to highlight associated opportunities for fostering a more inclusive,  circular waste management system to address plastic waste pollution. In partnership with cities,  the private sector,  informal waste worker cooperatives and regional thought leaders,  ESCAP encourages more sustainable consumption practices to return plastic resources to the production cycle; reduce plastic waste leakage into the environment and the oceans; and helps contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ESCAP provides a vital role in supporting capacity building initiatives with local and national governments to promote more circular waste economies.     The project developed and applied an assessment of plastic waste value chains to identify where different actors’ contributions intersect and several potential leakages of plastic waste that contribute to marine litter debris in partnership with waste cooperatives and local governments as well as the Stockholm Environment Institute,  Asia Centre. A longer term Phase II of the project is currently being designed.

3191	347	\N	The initiative of PLASTIC Cup was launched in 2013 by the non-profit NGO Filmjungle.eu Society. During this short time,  the initiative has drawn national and international attention to the Tisza; activated thousands of volunteers; and has removed 120 tonnes of plastic and other sorts of contamination from the river. It has started as a trash-boat race,  with the simple goal of collecting as many plastics from the river as possible. The best boat was given a fancy award made of recycled plastic: the PLASTIC Cup (hence the name,  after one of the world's most prestigious boat races - the America's Cup). By now PLASTIC Cup has become an ongoing,  all-year-round series of events. Awareness raising campaigns,  exhibitions,  movie screenings,  public talks and clean-up actions make the volunteers busy. Experts,  researchers have joined the project and so the systematic monitoring of the plastic contamination started. In the meantime,  the good old boat race has not been forgotten. On the contrary,  it's more popular than ever before. Implementation is carried out on 3 levels.     ●\tCLEANUPS ON LAND. Team building exercises,  small and large scale foodplain forest cleanups all year around for all age groups.  ●\tCLEANUP ACTIONS ON WATER. Short and long distance boat races,  large scale interventions accomplished in cooperation with water authorities,  companies and local settlements.  ●\tINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. Educational,  fundraising and awareness raising campaigns in upstream countries in order to reduce and wherever possible,  stop the pollution.

3304	362	\N	Rivers are the main source of ocean plastic pollution. They are the arteries that carry waste from land to the ocean. Our research found that 1000 rivers are responsible for roughly 80% of the pollution. The Interceptor is The Ocean Cleanup’s answer for river plastic waste. It is the first scalable solution to prevent plastic from entering the world’s oceans from rivers.  It is 100% solar-powered,  extracts plastic autonomously,  and is capable of operating in the majority of the world’s most polluting rivers.

41	Global Environmental Facility Funds	Financing Resource	\N	GEF funds are available to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to meet the objectives of the international environmental conventions and agreements.GEF-7 will explore the important synergies between the International Waters and the Chemicals and Waste focal areas to address specifically the challenge of marine litter and micro-plastics. Waste consisting of plastics can contribute to the POPs challenge as POPs contained in plastics can be released in the environment including oceans, if not properly managed. Marine litter in the form of micro-plastics to a significant extent derives from land-based activities and should also be seen in the context of waste management issues dealt with under this focal area. Recognizing the need to transform the entire life cycle of plastics to reduce marine plastic pollution, the GEF will invest in a few strategic Circular Economy initiatives to promote the adoption of closed loop production and consumption patterns instead of traditional linear take-make-waste approaches. Investments will be focusing on public/ private investments to transform the plastic life cycle.	6000000000	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_041.png	global	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:52.876276+00	2021-04-05 07:07:52.876276+00	\N	2018	2022	\N	\N	APPROVED	Total value of GEF POPs (persistent organic pollutants) portfolio over $6 billion.

76	Circularity Indicators Methodology	Technical Resource	\N	A circular economy is a global economic model that aims to decouple economic growth and development from the consumption of finite resources. Increasingly, companies see tremendous opportunity in this model, as it not only allows them to capture additional value from their products and materials, but also to mitigate risks from material price volatility and material supply. Until now, there has been no established way of measuring how effective a company is in making the transition from linear to circular models , nor have there been any supporting tools. The Circularity Indicators Project aims to address this gap and has developed indicators that assess how well a product or company performs in the context of a circular economy, thereby allowing companies to estimate how advanced they are on their journey from linear to circular. The developed indexes consist of a main indicator, the Material Circularity Indicator, measuring how restorative the material flows of a product or company are, and complementary indicato rs that allow additional impacts and risks to be taken into account. The indicators can be used as decision - making tool for designers, but might also be used for several other purposes including internal reporting, procurement decisions and the evaluation or rating of companies. In addition to the methodology, the Circularity Indicators Project has contributed to the development of a web - based measurement system for products, providing businesses with the tools required to track their progress in delivering a circular economy based business model. The purpose of this methodology paper is to describe the thinking behind this approach, alongside a comprehensive derivation of the equations used to calculate the Material Circularity Indicator.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_076.png	global	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:55.256666+00	2021-04-05 07:07:55.256666+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

79	Identifying Sources of Marine Litter	Technical Resource	\N	This report should support EU Member States in the implementation of monitoring programmes and plan of measures to act upon marine litter. The reduction of marine litter pollution poses a complex challenge for environmental policies, requiring adjustments in human behaviour as well as in the different phases of the life-cycle of products and access multiple economic sectors. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires European Member States to monitor marine litter and implement programmes of measures to reduce its occurrence. A crucial step in monitoring and effectively addressing marine litter is the identification of the origin and the pathways that lead to litter entering the marine environment. A wide variety of methods have been used over the years to determine the sources of marine litter, from simple counts of items believed to originate from a given source to more complex statistical methods. This report provides a brief overview of the main methods used and outlines one of the most promising approaches for determining sources – a Matrix Score Technique based on likelihoods, which considers the possibility that specific items originate from more than one source. Furthermore, it presents aseries of other parameters that can be used to analyse data-sets,  with regard to the use, origin and risk of items recorded in the marine or coastal environments. These can further support decision-making when considering preventive measures. Finally, recommendations to help the process of identification of sources are given, from the early stage of data collection and site characterization to bringing in the knowledge of local stakeholders to better determine where litter is coming from and what needs to be done to prevent it.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_79.png	transnational	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:55.428618+00	2021-04-05 07:07:55.428618+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

Furthermore, a framework — or step-by-step model — is presented as a source of inspiration for drawing up an individual waste management plan. Waste management planning is the cornerstone of any national, regional or local policy on waste management. The establishment of a plan allows taking stock of the existing situation, defining the objectives that need to be met, formulating appropriate strategies, and identifying the necessary implementation means. The drawing up of waste management plans is an obligation of EU Member States and is required by Article 28 of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Member States can ask the regional or local authorities to draw up regional or local plans. The plans shall cover the entire geographical territory of a Member State and need to be in line with the provisions of Article 1 WFD (protection of environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste and by reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use), Article 4 WFD (the waste management hierarchy), Article 13 WFD (protection of human health and environment), and Article 16 WFD (principles of self-sufficiency and proximity). Article 28(3) WFD lists the mandatory elements of a waste management plan. Article 28(4) WFD lists additional elements which may be contained in the plan.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_084.png	transnational	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:56.080431+00	2021-04-05 07:07:56.080431+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N
85	Riverine Litter Monitoring - Options and Recommendations	Technical Resource	\N	This technical report compiles the options for monitoring riverine litter and quantifying litter fluxes, focusing on anthropogenic litter. It includes the current scientific and technical background regarding litter in river systems, their flow regime and basic properties. The document aims to provide recommendations for monitoring approaches and methodologies. It also provides indications on the issues which need to be further developed in a collaborative approach. An extensive literature review has been performed in order to identify the existing options for the monitoring of litter items in rivers. Different monitoring methods are used in two environmental compartments: river water bodies and riverbanks. For a river water body, the river water surface can be monitored by visual observation and image acquisition, while collection methodologies for the water column include the use of retaining structures and sampling using grids, nets and filtration systems (with different mesh sizes and openings) at different water depths. Riverbank monitoring comprises the observation and eventual collection of litter items and sediment samples from the riverbanks. Methodologies are described and technical details are reported whenever available.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_085.png	transnational	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:56.206345+00	2021-04-05 07:07:56.206345+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

87	Plastics Waste Trade and the Environment	Technical Resource	\N	This briefing provides an overview of exports of plastic waste from the 28 EU Member States (EU-28) to other countries and discusses its possible consequences and opportunities. It  builds on a report by the EEAs European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE). Annual global plastic production has increased from 2 to 380 million tonnes since 1950 and is projected to double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. European countries lack the capacity to manage growing amounts of plastic waste in circular and sustainable ways. In early 2019, the EU exported around 150 000 tonnes of plastic waste per month. This figure was about twice as high in 2015 and 2016 - up to 300.000 tons monthly - when exports went to China and Hong Kong primarily. Import restrictions are the reason for the decrease and shift in exports of plastic waste to other countries in Asia. Poor management of plastic waste has negative environmental and climate effects, such as deposits of plastic and microplastics appearing on land and in rivers and oceans worldwide. Plastic contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions from production and from waste management, and to harmful effects from chemicals and water use. There is little knowledge or transparency about how plastic waste imported from the EU is managed in other countries. Recent restrictions on imports of plastic waste in China, combined with some types of plastic being added to the Basel Convention, is likely to further decrease EU exports. This poses the risk of increased incineration and landfilling of plastic waste in Europe. The EU must find circular and climate-friendly ways of managing its plastic waste e.g. by increasing reuse and recycling.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_087.png	transnational	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:56.492668+00	2021-04-05 07:07:56.492668+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

136	PlasticBudget: Accounting of plastics in the environment	Technical Resource	\N	In order to take political action, it is important to know the sources, quantities, and distribution of plastics in the environment. The findings should be used to derive a per capita budget for plastics that defines the maximum ecologically compatible quantity of emissions per person. In addition, methods are being developed to adequately reflect the potential effects of macro- and microplastic emissions in eco-assessments. The project results create a quantitative basis for future political decision-making processes. The PlasticBudget project is therefore divided into two parts: 1) Development of a budget approach that can be used to determine the permissible global total quantities in water bodies and the annual per capita emissions of plastics into the environment. 2) Development of an impact assessment methodology with corresponding environmental indicators in order to consider the plastic waste problem in environmental auditing. Similar to the balance calculation for greenhouse gases in the climate problem, reference variables such as plastic equivalents are developed as a basis for decision-making.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_136.png	global	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:59.713789+00	2021-04-05 07:07:59.713789+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

138	Plastic Pollution Calculator	Technical Resource	\N	The ISWA Plastic Waste Pollution Calculator is a toolkit developed by the University of Leeds on behalf of the Task Force on Marine Litter, an initiative of ISWA . Its objective is to allow municipalities, NGOs and governments to map the flow over time of macro-sized plastic waste items throughout their region, from the point of generation to their eventual disposal or fate in the environment. By answering a series of questions on the local socio-economic, environmental and technical conditions, particularly regarding the details of waste and resources management techniques and infrastructure, the calculator is able to identify mechanisms by which plastic items may become mismanaged and subsequently transported to waterways based on each items physical properties . As the flow of mass is mapped throughout the waste management system, this allows the quantification of plastic pollution sources and identification of prioritised interventions .The tool is applied at a district (neighbourhood) level, however results can be combined to analyse waste flows over larger regions or on a watershed level. Two levels of assessment, broad and detailed, allow greater flexibility based on local requirements and resources.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_138.png	national	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:07:59.843445+00	2021-04-05 07:07:59.843445+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N
139	Marine Plastic Footprint	Technical Resource	\N	The Marine Plastic Footprint methodology was being developed by IUCN in collaboration with EA.

189	EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines	Technical Resource	\N	Measures against marine litter require quantitative data for the assessment of litter abundance, trends and distribution. While beach litter monitoring has been ongoing in some European areas since years, so far it was yet not possible to obtain an overview and to analyse litter abundance, litter category distribution and trends at the different spatial scales from local to EU. Therefore, the EU Marine Directors and the Marine Strategy Coordination Group mandated, in the context of the MSFD implementation, to the MSFD Technical Group on Marine Litter and the JRC, the compilation and analysis of an EU beach litter dataset. Aim was to derive EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines at different spatial levels. After collection of European beach litter data from EU Member States via the EMODNET chemistry module database, harmonisation of data formats and data clean-up, a 2012-2016 dataset was derived. Following the spatio-temporal aggregation of data. The application of agreed scenario parameters has enabled the calculation of marine beach litter baselines for the years 2015 and 2016 at spatial scales ranging from country and country –region level to sub-regional, regional and EU level. Litter categories have been aggregated and allow analysis of group categories up to EU level, whereas the analysis of single categories could not include all received data due to non-comparable litter type category descriptions. and the identification of possible litter category analysis, different scenarios for baseline setting have been tested and evaluated. The resulting set of baselines enables the future monitoring of progress in reduction, as well as compliance checking developed using the dataset. Furthermore, it provides valuable information for future improving harmonised monitoring through updated guidance, common data treatment and agreed data reporting formats. Beach litter abundance has been found to be very high in large areas of Europe, requiring joint and strong action in Europe and with the neighbours in shared marine basins.	\N	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/resource_189.png	transnational	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:01.903447+00	2021-04-05 07:08:01.903447+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

252	Strategic Plan For Monitoring And Evaluation Of Garbage In The Sea Of The State OfSão Paulo (PEMALM)	Technical Resource	\N	Coastal and marine environments are important providers of ecosystem services, among which  is the regulation of our planets climate. In Brazil, some of the largest cities of the country are found  along the coastline, concentrating intense economic activity that relies on, impacts, and shares space  with a rich, though vulnerable, biodiversity. Recognizing this dynamic is fundamental to think, plan  and act to guarantee a viable future. For FUNBIO, the support to projects aiming for ocean knowledge  and conservation has always been a priority. And it is with great satisfaction that we take part in the  initiative that has generated the present São Paulo Strategic Plan for Monitoring and Assessment  of Marine Litter (PEMALM), a partnership involving the University of São Paulo, the Norwegian  Embassy and the Secretariat of Infrastructure and Environment of the State of São Paulo. Since the early days of its activities, in 1996, FUNBIO has supported the creation and  strengthening of marine and coastal protected areas. This also extends to studies about species, coastal  and marine environments, and fishery resources. The plan represents an important step towards the  creation of an information database in the state of São Paulo, which can subsidize future means to  combat marine litter. A global and growing challenge that requires equally global, and ever-increasing,  knowledge and effort from all of society for mitigation.	\N	\N	\N	{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFXQIJjEZ0dRwfeXzun1EoKHP-D8PVMU/view}	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:04.918601+00	2021-04-05 07:08:04.918601+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N
253	Marine Litter: Guidelines fordesigning action plans	Technical Resource	\N	Marine litter is increasingly an issue requiring urgent transboundary cooperation both at an international and a regional level. The issue is common to all of the worlds oceans. Marine litter and microplastics is found on beaches, floating on the surface of the oceans, suspended in the water column, in sediments and settled on the seabed. Marine litter mostly results from mismanagement of plastic waste at various stages within the lifecycle of products. The processes that result in plastic waste entering the marine environment are broadly the same for all States, but significant differences can also be found.	\N	\N	global	{}	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:04.939503+00	2021-04-05 07:08:04.939503+00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

277	NOAA Marine Debris Program Strategic Plan	Technical Resource	\N	Marine debris touches every corner of the world, from remote islands to the worlds largest cities, and it is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of the issue. However, there is hope. Marine debris is a human-caused problem and, therefore, has human solutions. As public awareness of and interest in marine debris continues to grow, so does the community of people working to address the issue. Since the inception of the NOAA Marine Debris Program in 2006, NOAA has strived to help find solutions to the marine debris problem. The fiscal year 2021-2025 Strategic Plan highlights how the MDP will work with dedicated staff and partners for the next five years to make a measurable change toward reaching our vision: the global ocean and its coasts free from the impacts of marine debris. Six goals will guide the next five years: prevention, removal, research, response, coordination, and a new goal: monitoring and detection. The fiscal year 2021-2025 Strategic Plan also includes a new focus on using innovative technology and a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity.This plan will drive daily operations, set annual milestones, and challenge the MDP to reach more ambitious goals than ever previously set. The path forward is one filled with hope for a healthier ocean and healthier planet.	\N	\N	national	{https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/NOAA%20Marine%20Debris%20Program%202021-2025%20Strategic%20Plan_0.pdf}	\N	2021-04-05 07:08:05.424465+00	2021-04-05 07:08:05.424465+00	\N	2021	2025	\N	\N	APPROVED	\N	\N	\N

75	The 3R Initiative: Credit-based market system to encourage plastic recycling and recovery	2019	35	Partnerships	Development	f	contact@3rinitiative.org	national	{}	To catalyse zero plastic waste leadership, the 3R Initiative (3RI) is developing a market-based approach that will scale up recovery and recycling activities and increase accountability for plastic waste reduction efforts around the world. The 3RI supports a market for plastic credits which will transparently and sustainably increase the value of plastic and beverage carton waste, and incentivize new activities that support the circular economy. The 3RI supports the following three elements:The Guidelines for Corporate Plastic Stewardship facilitate corporate plastic footprint assessment and communication of credible mitigation actions, enabling companies to meet leadership commitments. The Guidelines, which the 3RI developed in coordination with South Pole (a 3RI member), EA and Quantis, share principles of credible corporate plastic stewardship programs, key metrics for accounting for plastic footprint and leakage, guidance for the appropriate implementation of a range of plastic waste mitigation activities, and leadership claims related to plastic waste and circularity.     The Plastic Waste Reduction Standard (Plastic Standard) is an efficient and powerful means of supporting activities that verifiably reduce plastic in the environment anywhere in the world. The Plastic Standard, developed by Verra with the support of the 3R Initiative, establishes consistent accounting and verification processes for plastic waste collection and/or recycling activities and enables the issuance of credits for plastic collected and recycled above baseline rates. The independently-audited Plastic Standard includes significant social and environmental safeguards.     The Circular Action Hub: a platform that connects local waste management projects and activities with companies and investors willing to support, accelerate and strengthen a more effective and socially-responsible circular economy. The Circular Action Hub, developed and managed by BVRio, aims to create demand, price discovery and liquidity for 3R Initiative pilots and Plastic Credits certified to the Plastic Waste Reduction Standard. It promotes a wide range of activities and funding pathways, including sponsorship, investment, or credit purchase.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.822244+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.822244+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://3rinitiative.org/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_075.png	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_75_logo.png	\N

1	Gringgo: Investing in garbage to clean oceans	2014	106	Startup	Scale up	f	info@gringgo.co	national	{}	Indonesia based foundation, Gringgo is a data driven trash tech startup that's works towards making smarter waste collection: a service that is more reliable, cheaper and greener and also creates more jobs and higher incomes for waste workers. More than 10,000 tons of plastics are used every day in Indonesia. 50% of Indonesians don't have waste collection so dumping into rivers is all too common. Plastic ends up in their oceans and now they are the no. 2 marine plastic polluter in the world.Gringgo initially started as CashForTrash in late 2014. Founded by a team gathered during Startup Weekend Bali 2014 at HUBUD co-working space. It was initially created as a platform for recycling aimed at local schools to make recycling easier, rewarding and fun. The concept has evolved and is now called Gringgo. Once the customers/investors buy garbage, Ginggo harvests the recyclables and sells them to factories and processors for recycling. They then share the profits with the customers/investors.People living in Bali can see on a wastemap all the locations where they can drop their recyclable waste.Users can check through Gringgo's website the list of recyclable items and the current prices. Gringgo also provides through its app a tool for residents to submit pollution complaints and issues such as illegal dumping and open burning of waste. The foundation currently handles over 340 metric tons/month of garbage and have improved recycling rates to over 35%. Their aim is to recycle over 60% of the garbage they collect and expand to other villages across Bali over the coming months.	2021-04-05 07:08:05.967195+00	2021-04-05 07:08:05.967195+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://www.gringgo.co/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_001.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_01_logo.jpg	\N
58	Ellipsis: Machine learning and aerial imagery to identify, map, and track plastic waste	2019	83	Startup	In market	f	info@ellipsis.earth	national	{}	Ellipsis Earth has developed a unique technology to detect, map, and track plastic waste globally via machine learning algorithms and high tech imagery. Globally, plastic waste is an area of growing concern due to its harmful effects on the environment and all living beings. While 10 million tonnes of plastic waste finds its way into our oceans annually, there is still 99% of plastic waste that is unaccounted for, with no reliable data available on where this plastic waste eventually ends up. Lack of clear data on this plastic waste hinders our ability to identify it for recycling or proper disposal, thereby increasing the harmful impact it has on our environment.Ellipsis Earths technology can not only identify plastic waste around the world, but also classify it into different categories such as bottles, containers, sheets, etc. This data can eventually be used by governments and companies to identify plastic accumulation areas and collect the waste for recycling or safe disposal.The data can also be used to inform and educate the public on how and where plastic waste accumulates so that corrective measures can be taken and environment-friendly initiatives can be planned.Ellipsis does this by capturing video and stills from around the world using any source, be it drones, submarines, satellites, or CCTV, and feeding the visuals into its proprietary identification platform. If needed, it can even deploy a drone from its network of over 500 drones to capture images and videos of client sites.All the images are stitched together into a master image for geospatial mapping. The Ellipsis software, through its custom machine learning, can identify plastic with 93% accuracy and 95% certainty. It then classifies the plastic into different categories. The algorithm can also be tailored to identify different types of plastic, brands, and local items.Based on the plastic found in that particular area, it also creates heat maps which can be updated over time. The collected data is then used to prepare content to create awareness about plastic wastage.Buoyed by its success, Ellipsis is launching a mobile app in 2020 for the public. Some of the partners with whom Ellipsis works are National Geographic, Marevivo, BAT, Encounter Edu, and British Science Association, among others.NGOs, government organisations, companies working in the field of plastic management and wastage are the potential clients for Ellipsis Earth.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.196901+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.196901+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.ellipsis.earth/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_058.jpeg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_58_logo.jpg	\N
2	Ichthion: Technology to remove plastic and synthetic waste from oceans	2017	83	Startup	Prototype	f	hello@remora-marine.co.uk	national	{}	Ichthion (previously Remora Marine) develops a cutting-edge technology to restore the ocean environment by removing plastics and synthetic waste, before they travel through the entire ocean ecosystem.Microplastics in the sea are a growing threat to human health. Almost 8 million tonnes of plastic waste enter the oceans per year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, with an exponential increase predicted over the coming years. This is a problem of unfathomable scale with far-reaching effects for wildlife and for humanity, one that makes the future of the oceans seem bleak.Born out of the laboratories of Imperial College London and the studios of the Royal College of Art, Ichthion was created with the sole purpose of restoring the ocean environment. It utilizes the latest technology and research along with a self-critical approach to innovation to ensure its solution remains effective without compromise.They have developed three types of technology streams: Azure, Cobalt and Ultramarine. These operate in different environments to prevent macro and micro plastics entering into the phytoplankton growth areas in coastal zones, and also for the reclamation of plastics in the ocean. Their systems are in Technology Readiness Level 3 (Proof of concept). The potential of their energy-generative systems to tackle the global problem of plastic pollution has been recognized by several prominent organizations through several awards and grants. For example, the Scalable Business Award by Imperial College London, two grants from Climate-KIC, the EU's main climate innovation initiative, the Hawley Award from the Worshipful Company of Engineers. They won the Plastics innovation competition: towards zero waste of Innovate UK.As attempts to clean up the oceans are often highlighted as being cost prohibitive and unlikely to succeed based on scaling factors, Ichthion adopts the same strategy as the eponymous fish. It will circumvent both of these issues simultaneously by using existing infrastructures and adding the technology into them. This gives the necessary scale, avoids huge start up costs, and overlaps coverage with the ecologically important coastal zones.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.00404+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.00404+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.ichthion.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_002.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_02_logo.jpeg	\N
3	Microplastic-sensing Drone	2001	253	Non-Profit Org	Scale up	f	info@sprout.cc	national	{}	As a not-for-profit engineering innovation company, Draper provides unbiased assessments of technology or systems designed or recommended by other organizations — whether custom-designed or commercial-off-the-shelf.Microplastics in the oceans waterways are an ever-growing invisible threat, one that is increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives. This led them to team up with the EPA to combat one of the biggest problems in the world: microplastic contamination. The Mircoplastics-Sensing Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is the first-in-class for microplastic sensing drones. Drapers AUV can detect and analyze invisible microplastics, and enable scientists to understand where they are originating from, where they are most prominent and how to prevent them from contaminating our waters. When the AUV is deployed, it skims the top nine meters of the water where most microplastics are located, scanning for microplastics, testing for specific types, and ultimately relaying GPS coordinates into a heat map.They did this by creating the worlds first real-time microplastic-sensing system in the form of a full-size autonomous underwater drone. The drone will search, find, and analyze this invisible threat to the worlds oceans, coastal regions, and rivers. This will also enable scientists to understand where microplastics originate from and how to prevent them from contaminating our waters.Draper hopes to launch a Plastic Particle Pollution Index posting measurements and trend predictions of microplastic particle concentrations in the worlds oceans, coastal regions and rivers. Draper also plans to make its microplastic sensing technology widely available via open-sourcing so other can contribute to the ppp index.The project is also part of larger long-term strategic design initiative to develop an iconic visual brand language across Drapers different divisions and product categories.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.039108+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.039108+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.draper.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_003.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_03_logo.jpeg	\N
4	Nordsense: A complete end to end solution that optimizes waste collection processes	2015	65	Startup	In market	f	contact@nordsense.com	national	{}	A complete end to end solution that optimizes waste collection processes. Nordsense provides a complete end to end solution that optimizes waste collection processes by monitoring container levels, applying advanced data analytics and reducing waste collection trips. It uses cloud-based solutions and artificial intelligence to enable turn-by-turn navigation for waste collection. This eliminates stopping at half empty containers.The solutions it offers are:NS Pod: a small device that can be used with any container or bin. Its novel feature is that it can estimate levels also of plastic bags.NS Platform: It is possible to login to this platform from any device. It provides real time information on bins needing collection. So collection trips and even placement of bins can be optimized so overfull bins are a thing of the past.NS Navigator: This is a mobile application for drivers on collection duties. It lets them know when they have to work, and besides showing the optimal route, it provides directions on which container to stop at. Since information is added in real time, the whole process is dynamic and event driven, and additional full bins can easily be added in the route. It also provides important analytics such as trip duration and cost estimation.The result is that collection trips are minimized,fuel is saved, and trash is collected before containers are overflowing, which leads to illegal dumping. Moreover, congestion on roads by these larger haulers is avoided as well.Nordsense is based in Copenhagen and was started in 2016. Besides working in Copenhagen, they also provide services at San Francisco Public Works. Søren Christensen is the founder and CEO at Nordsense Inc. The company has been covered heavily in Swedish press.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.087542+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.087542+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://nordsense.com	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_004.png	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_04_logo.jpg	\N
5	Orca Sound Project: Empowering eco-innovation to save our oceans through sense based experiences and collaboration	2018	83	Startup	Pilot	f	posey@orcasoundproject.com	national	{}	Orca Sound Project is a creative platform for sense based experiences and collaborations to raise awareness of our oceans. About 8 million metric tonnes of plastic is dumped in the oceans each year. At the current rate, it is estimated that there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans by 2050. To top it off, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled globally. Orca Sound Project aims to contribute towards reducing the plastic waste present in oceans through creative collaborations and innovations. The organization partners with numerous sound artists and music festival organizers to arrange an event centered around sustainability and ocean conservations. This includes arranging ocean cleanups and ensuring the elimination of single-use plastics.  Orca Sound Project also upcycles the collected wastes into useful products like Orcaboard. Orcaboard is plywood manufactured from 100% mixed waste plastic. Each Orcaboard requires about 30 kg plastic waste sourced directly from the ocean or from the land. The resulting material is sturdy, waterproof and easily washable, making it ideal for temporary use in constructions for events and festivals.In collaboration with Keep Britain Tidy and Shangri-La Glastonbury, they developed the project to build the Glastonbury Music Festival Arena completely from recycled plastic. Waste collection for the project took place between May 11 and May 23, 2019, and an approximate 10 tonnes of plastic was used and processed by Exeter City Council before being recycled into materials to build the stage.The organization also supports global fisheries encouraging them to pick up waste from the oceans in an effort to reduce plastic pollution and combat overfishing.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.104068+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.104068+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://www.orcasoundproject.com	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_005.png	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_05_logo.jpg	\N

12	Blue Ocean Gear: Connected, intelligent fishing gear for commercial fishing fleets	\N	253	Startup	Pilot	f	\N	national	{}	Blue Ocean Gear has developed Smart Buoy technology that allows fishermen to track and locate their fishing gear.Lost fishing gear has global economic and environmental impacts on the ocean, as well as the people and industries that rely on it. Despite fishermens best efforts, fishing gear is lost due to many uncontrollable forces including storms and strong currents. Lost gear continues fishing indiscriminately—both target species and bycatch—without being harvested. This ghost gear depletes the current biomass, reduces future harvests and fishing industry revenue.              Blue Ocean Gears Smart Buoy technology tracks fishing gear at all times, including traps and nets that are far offshore. These buoys alert fishermen of their new location when gear has moved too far, allowing for direct retrieval rather than aimless searching. A wide variety of data from the buoys can be used to help ocean businesses run more efficient and cost-effective operations, both on- and off-shore.Blue Ocean Gears Mission aligns strongly with the UN SDG 14 by addressing marine pollution and working toward sustainable fisheries. They want the ocean to be around for us to use today and far into the future.

15	Clear Blue Sea: Solar-powered, semi-autonomous Floating Robot For Eliminating Debris (FRED) that cleans oceans	2016	253	Non-Profit Org	Prototype	t	\N	national	{}	Description: Our Concept of Operations is to implement fleets of 100s of FREDs, ranging in size from 50-100 feet, for cleanup of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, coastlines, bays, estuaries, and rivers. FREDs will operate autonomously in the ocean gyres, except when they need human intervention, at which point the Clear Blue Sea staff in our mission control center will take over FRED navigation and perform remote control of FREDs operations and routing.FREDs architecture is comprised of a simple set of subsystems:VESSEL PLATFORM SUBSYSTEM  The supporting elements of FREDs architecture are the hulls and cross beams, which support debris collection and power, and enable FRED to float in marine environments. Hulls can be made from various materials, such as commercial pontoons or fiberglass hulls, or they can be made from raw materials.\tDEBRIS COLLECTION SUBSYSTEM FRED utilizes booms, belts, and bins to capture and store floating marine plastic and debris polluting the environment. The booms, which are floating arms attached to the hull frame, guide floating plastic pollution up onto the conveyor belt, and can be made of plastic, metal, or composite material. The conveyor belt, which is powered by motors receiving electricity from the Power Subsystem, is attached to the hull frame for stability. Marine debris is taken by FREDs conveyor belt to an embedded storage bin, which is sized appropriately for one mission and is able to drain water to lighten the load. POWER SUBSYSTEM FRED is designed to use sustainable energy. To capture the suns energy, FRED utilizes an array of marine-worthy solar panels forming the roof of the vessel. Solar panels can be in the form of flexible, malleable material, or rigid planes that are individually framed. Onboard batteries store electrical energy generated from the solar panels.NAVIGATION SUBSYSTEM FREDs hulls are propelled forward using electrical motors which receive electricity from the solar panel/battery assembly. Propulsion by the motors can be made autonomous or performed via remote control.SENSOR SUBSYSTEM FREDs architecture provides a platform for embedding scientific sensors and instrumentation to be used for collecting data and samples from the environment. Some sensors provide performance information, such as FREDs speed and location, and other sensors capture weather data, such as air and water temperature, wind speed, and current strength. FREDs sensors are powered by solar energy.DATA COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEMWhile FRED is in marine environments, its data communications capability enables commands to be transmitted from ground control to FRED and operational data to be transmitted from FRED to ground control. This enables remote control, navigational routes, and display of FRED operational data. Our 50-foot FRED is designed to deliver the following enhanced capabilities per our system requirements baseline:•\tCollect floating marine plastic and debris ranging in size from 5mm to 5 meters on a 24/7 basis•\tPropel at 2 knots to prevent unannounced infringement on marine life•\tNavigate autonomously based on GPS trajectory commands from mission control staff•\tNavigate under remote control during unsafe conditions (storms, etc.)•\tUtilize only solar power for FRED operations with stored energy available on cloudy days  •\tProvide excess stored energy to governmental and commercial marine Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) for recharging their batteries without having to return to land•\tAlert marine mammals of FRED proximity using appropriate acoustic pingers recommended by marine scientists at Scripps Institute of Oceanography•\tCapture environmental, oceanographic, and marine ecosystem data in real-time for transmittal to designated scientific, governmental, and commercial information systems•\tTransmit sensor and instrumentation data to ground-based mission control systems for Clear Blue Sea staff to monitor, govern, and control fleets of FREDs as requiredPlastic recovery capacity: A scaled-up version of FRED (50 feet long by 30 feet wide), which will be used in Hawaii for our Phase III Pilot Program, will collect an estimated 750 cubic yards of plastic, per FRED, per year. Using the weight of a large plastic bottle, this equates to 56,250 pounds of collected plastic each year, for each FRED in the fleet.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.535074+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.535074+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://clearbluesea.org/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_015.png	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_15_logo.png	\N

The robot can collect different type of waste thanks to its variety of nets: - Reusable micro-waste net (180/250/300 microns mesh)- Reusable milli-waste net (1mm mesh)- Reusable recycled macro-waste net (0,5 to 1cm mesh)The collected waste can be: plastic (e.g. bottles, packaging, cigarette butts), glass (e.g. floating glass bottles filled with air), metallic (e.g. cans and metal cans filled with air, organic waste (e.g. dead fish), natural debris (e.g. driftwood) and floating algae (e.g. duckweed and algae that are not filamentous or stowed at the bottom). In addition, the robot can directly collect in the net any type of floating oil. viscous type hydrocarbons (ex: oil slabs) and light type hydrocarbons (e.g. oils, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil).With its compact size, the remote-controlled Jellyfishbot can easily access hard-to-reach and/or shallow areas where waste is usually accumulated (e.g. between boats, under the ropes, against/under docks or pontoons) in any sheltered areas such ports, marinas, lakes, ponds, etc.Plastic recovery capacity: Our nets are able to collect 80L of plastic each. After that, the user has to empty the net and reuse it to collect 80L of plastic once again. The Jellyfishbot can also clean a 1000m² surface at 1 knot speed. It is extremely easy to change the net by simply using a pole to retrieve it. There is no need to take the robot out of the water.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.789581+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.789581+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.iadys.com	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_021.JPG	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_21_logo.png	\N
22	Litter Trap: Preventing plastic litter from entering seas and oceans	2014	170	Non-Profit Org	Scale up	t	info@clearrivers.eu	national	{}	Description: Technical specifications:The Litter Trap is a floating device able to capture plastic litter carried by the river current or wind. CLEAR RIVERS makes the circular approach a crucial element of its strategy, therefore the Litter Traps are almost entirely made from recycled plastic retrieved from the rivers. The device is placed in the opposite direction of the water current making our product both cost-efficient and energy-autonomous. In fact, plastic debris is carried towards the opening of the Litter Trap by the current and the wind and the system does not require energy or human labour to function. Once the litter is trapped inside, it will not be able to “escape” even if the current changes direction, thanks to an innovative semi-closed- door system. Neither the instalment of the Trap nor its operation will cause any harm to the environment. In fact, CLEAR RIVERS designed openings in order to create escape routes for fish and other animals. Birds can also fly through the open part of the Trap. This is a great way to retrieve plastic litter without obstructing the pathways of aquatic organisms.After thorough analyses of the morphological and physical characteristics of rivers and canals, as well as a detailed study of wind and water currents, CLEAR RIVERS designed a modular Litter Trap (made from recycled plastic) that can be transported or shipped everywhere around the world. CLEAR RIVERS is currently developing different types of Litter Trap, where dimensions, capacity and costs change in order to be suitable for rivers and countries worldwide.Potential bottlenecks: - Risk of flooding; in rivers with an extreme fluctuation in water level, the Litter Trap needs an extra secure anchoring system.- Ship traffic; To extend the reach of the Litter Traps we attach floating booms to it to guide the floating debris into the Litter Trap. Intense ship traffic will give limitations to the placement of the booms. A way to overcome this is to have a (small) repetition of Litter Traps, to still retrieve the litter in the second Litter Trap that passed by the first instalment. Measures to avoid collection of biological components:Biological elements can enter the Litter Traps, but can easily be removed on site. The Litter Trap is accessible for emptying and the removal of any obstacles. Plastic recovery capacity: 5m3 per emptying depending on the preferred system (CLEAR RIVERS offers different dimensions for the system; scalable approach). The frequency of emptying depends on the local situation: how fast the Litter Trap fills up, due to weather conditions, pollution quantity, possibilities of local partners to empty, etc.	2021-04-05 07:08:06.798256+00	2021-04-05 07:08:06.798256+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://www.clearrivers.eu	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_022.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_22_logo.JPG	\N

26	Net-Works: Collecting discarded fishing nets from coastal communities and recycling them into carpet tiles	2012	180	Established Company	In market	f	info@net-works.com	national	{}	Net-WorksTM redesigns global supply chains to create sustainable and scalable solutions that reduce marine plastic, increase fish stocks and improve the lives of marginalized coastal communities living in biodiversity hotspots of developing countries.On the current trajectory of plastic pollution and over fishing there will be one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of fish in the ocean by 2025. The people most affected are those in marginalized rural communities within biodiversity hotspots of the developing world, especially in Southeast Asia which contributes for over 60% of the worlds marine debris, is the center of marine biodiversity, contains 55% of the global population of artisanal reef fishers and suffers the highest level of fishing pressure.Net-Works provides a simple, scalable and holistic model to deliver less plastic, more fish and improve the lives of marginalized coastal communities across Southeast Asia by applying the principles of fair trade and inclusive business. They created efficient community-based supply chains for raw materials (plastics and seaweed carrageenan) that are available in abundance. They link these raw materials to conservation actions that reduce plastic pollution and restore coastal ecosystems. Increasing incomes from seaweed reduces dependence on fishing & enables communities to set aside larger No-Take zones (NTZs). They sell these raw materials into global supply chains, giving international brands opportunities to source premium products with positive social and environmental stories, giving fishing communities a more transparent and dependable price, and providing sustainable funding sources for local conservation and development actions. To manage local supply chains, they set up community banks, bringing communities together in informal cooperatives and providing much-needed access to financial services, using the globally recognized and proven Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model. These community banks are the social glue at the heart of Net-Works, enabling members to invest in their sustainable livelihoods, building a Net-Works conservation constituency. So far they have:Collected >195 metric tonnes of nets (increasing daily) which have been recycled into high quality nylon yarn and sold to Interface, Inc. to make high design carpet tiles.Conducted successful scientific trials of ecological seaweed farming in the Philippines.

31	One Earth - One Ocean: Marine vessels to collect, sort and process plastic waste from the oceans	2011	62	Non-Profit Org	Scale up	f	\N	national	{}	Germany-based One Earth-One Ocean is a nonprofit organization working towards cleaning up oceans globally to free them from marine litter and oil and chemical pollution.One Earth-One Ocean (OEOO) aims to reduce the extent of ocean pollution through the concept and technology of the 'Marine Litter Cleanup'.The Marine Litter Cleanup project comprises of two collection vessels which can be used in inland waters or oceans to collect plastic waste from rivers. The project aims to collect, sort and process the waste to create recycled plastic bales along with recovering fuel and energy. So far, the project has been deployed in two stages:SeeHamster: the first generation collectors launched in 2012 have been updated to the 5th generation in 2019. These are small catamarans about four metres long and two metres wide and a fold-down net or fishing gear with which plastic garbage from inland waters is collected. The SeeHamsters are in use in Cambodia, Germany and Asia. SeeKuh: launched in Lubek in 2016, the collector can gather the waste from a depth of 4 metres. The ship, also based on the catamaran shape, has a size of 12 x 10 meters and will clean bays, estuaries and coastal sections. It is also equipped with a water analyzer which can test water samples to identify the type of waste or other sources of pollution. The SeeKuh vessels are the first to be licensed by DNV/GL worldwide. OEOO aims to make the SeeKuh vessels completely reliant on renewable energy sources like solar or wind in the future. Additionally, OEOO has launched the SeeElefant, which treats, sorts and processes the waste collected by the vessels using a plant technology that has been integrated into the ship. The SeeElefant can produce plastic bales as well as recover energy and fuel from the waste. The plastic waste is crushed and cleaned and plastics like PVC and PET are sorted out. The remaining mixture is melted and evaporated to separate chlorine and sulfur. The remaining gas is then condensed to obtain fuel. Around 30% of the fuel is consumed by the vessels and the rest can be sold to other ships and vessels. Waste processing is done in partnership with BIOFABRIK, using their WASTX Plastic technology. OEOO has also built the International Marine Litter Database, an extensive database comprising of scientific studies and findings on marine litter from around the world. One Earth-One Ocean has received a number of awards for their work, including 2017 European Inventor Award and the Federal Award for Ecodesign in 2019.

38	Plastic Vortex: floating device that captures floating waste from rivers	2016	79	Non-Profit Org	Scale up	f	contactplasticvortex@gmail.com	national	{}	Based in Toulouse, France; Plastic Vortex is a system that captures floating plastic waste from rivers using a device that does not use any electrical or fuel power.Nearly 80% of the waste pollution in the oceans comes from urban pollution through rivers. Plastic Vortex aims to reduce such upstream pollution using a simple system that captures the waste floating down rivers.The Plastic Vortex system consists of a floating platform connected with floating arms that make a V-shape. The system faces the downstream flow of a river. All floating waste is captured by the arms and directed towards the platform at the centre.The waste is transferred to a tub by a conveyor belt, which is rotated by turbines that run on the river currents and not on electricity or fuel. The tub is carried to the shore using a hand-operated pulley.The floating devices and arms are made of waste materials like plastic bottles.The Plastic Vortex team visits the system, which is installed on the Garrone river, several times during the week depending on the weather conditions. They recover an average of thirty plastic bottles at each visit. The system which has so far collected 112 kilograms of floating waste including 1,083 plastic bottles. The inventor is seeking €35,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to produce and deploy its second system in 2020. It is doing research to make the system more reliable and aims to deploy it on other rivers in the Occitanie region and eventually in all of France.Its partners include Orange Foundation, Dassault Systems, FAB14+, and Artilect.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.577495+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.577495+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://plasticvortex.co/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_038.jpeg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_38_logo.png	\N

The currency can be used at restaurants and stores.Nearly 13 million tonnes of plastic waste is not recycled and ends up in the worlds oceans, according to the United Nations. In Uruguay, a country of 3.4 million people, only 35% of plastic waste is collected for recycling.Plasticoin aims to incentivize consumers to deposit their plastic waste in return for virtual currency. The project is undergoing pilot tests at a seaside resort in Piriapolis city on the countrys Atlantic Ocean coast:Consumers can register online and deposit plastic waste from their household or collected from the beach at one of the three designated collection centers. They receive Plasticoin currency on their phone based on the weight and type of waste discarded. The minimum waste is one kg, for which they receive Plasticoins. To promote clean coastal zones, plastic waste and microplastic removed from beaches and oceans results in a higher Plasticoin payment.The customers can use the currency to get discounts at partnered shops and restaurants. These include yoga centers, surfboard shops, and shops selling bags, toothbrushes, pizza, haircuts, and coffee, among other products.Plasticoins launched in January 2020 with a grant of $5000 from the Uruguan governments National Development Agency. The project received more than a thousand users within three weeks, against a target of 100 users in a month.The project is looking for companies that can provide discounts on their products to Plasticoin users. It is also looking for companies to advertise on the Plasticoin platform.

40	Plastix: Transforming waste fishing nets and trawls into plastic raw materials	2012	65	Established Company	In market	f	info@plastixglobal.com	national	{}	Plastix is a leading Danish clean tech company which transforms waste fishing nets and waste rigid plastics into high quality plastic raw materials. Plastix has developed a proprietary technology and process system to handle very tough waste fractions such as trawls and nets. The fishing waste they collect provides raw material for producing secondary plastic material that they sell.The high quality plastic collected and recycled from oceans is called OceanIX and the one recycled from land waste is called NordIX. Both these plastics can be used by themselves or in a blend for producing new items. Regular users of their material can get a certificate as “Certified Recyclates User of Discarded Fishing Net and Trawl” to show as CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) achievements. They remind their clients that using their green material saves precious fossil fuels, reduces plastic pollution on land and oceans, and reduces CO2 emissions.Plastix has been co-funded by the European Union within the CIP Eco-Innovation initiative of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) through the Retrawl project. Plastix is located in Lemvig, Denmark and operates in Scandinavia, the Baltic Region, most of Europe and South Africa.Their technology transforms an extensive disposal/deposit problem – discarded fishing nets and other post-use plastic waste fractions –  into valuable recycled HDPE and PP plastics raw materials.Awareness of environmental impacts, geopolitics and a focus on increasing efficiency in the collecting of waste streams has created incentives for the fishing industry to stop dumping used fishing gear into the ocean, thus moving the issue to on-shore handling of nets and other types of gear.Their creativity for solutions derives from the imagination, designs, innovations, strategies and collective implementation methodologies that meet the diverse needs of their clients and partners. Through the use of technology, they provide treatment methods that have shown the ability to effectively recycle plastics and metals from net and trawl without downgrading the quality and thereby losing valuable resources. With their recycling technology the used maritime materials can be recycled 100% in a closed loop.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.652792+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.652792+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://plastixglobal.com	\N	\N	\N

42	Project STOP: Creating a comprehensive waste management system to stop ocean plastics leakage	\N	106	Partnerships	In market	t	info@stopoceanplastics.com	national	{}	Description: The world is struggling to answer the question: How do we stop ocean plastic leakage permanently, and do so as quickly and efficiently as possible? Permanent reduction results from solving the complex root causes behind mismanaged waste, deeply tied to the interwoven economic, regulatory, technical, social and behavioural norms of a region. Solutions need to be found that are culturally appropriate, inclusive, economically sustainable, technically rigorous, and built on a foundation of transparent, reliable governance, all of which takes time to develop. Yet, we are in a plastic crisis and need to move and scale quickly without neglecting the fundamental building blocks required for systemic change.  To do this, first, we must focus our time and resources where it matters most - on the locations with the highest pollution levels coupled with strong government and local commitment. We then need to unearth local collective wisdom and leadership, to quickly get to what will work and co-develop a plan forward that everyone can stand behind to develop economically sustainable, circular, zero leakage waste systems. We also need to ensure sufficient revenue is available to cover the costs of each waste system, especially in Indonesia where waste funding is generally insufficient.Project STOP partners with cities and local government to build resilient and economically sustainable waste systems that eliminate leakage of plastics into the environment and ocean.  Nearly 80% of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems comes from land sources. About 50% of this comes from emerging countries like Indonesia, China, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. Project STOP aims to assist countries like Indonesia who have pledged to reduce the country ocean levels by 70% by 2025. This is to be done by helping establish an effective waste management system in the country.  Launched in 2017, Project STOP is an initiative co-founded by Borealis and SYSTEMIQ that designs, implements, and scales circular economy solutions to prevent plastic pollution in Southeast Asia. Project STOP supports cities with experienced waste management, plastic recycling, organic waste management, community engagement, behavior change and program governance experts. The team works in a simple system: •\tScoping: Assessing cities for ocean pollution and government involvement. •\tPreparation & Design: Stakeholder agreements to build an effective waste management system. •\tImplementation: Equip the community to operate the waste management system economically. •\tScale Up: Expanding to new regions to establish change.  Working with companies, local governments and community groups, Project STOP also aims o create new jobs in waste management and reduce the harmful impact of mismanaged waste on public health, tourism and fisheries. Project STOPs long-term ambition is to establish new solutions and models that can be rapidly scaled-up across the whole plastics chain, from the uses of plastic to waste collection and recycling, in areas where there is need to improve the management of plastic waste. Project STOP currently works in the coastal cities of  Muncar (Population: 130,000 inhabitants) in East Java, Lekok and Ngulign in Pasuruan (Population: 130,000 inhabitants) in East Java, and Jembrana (Population: 160,000 inhabitants) in northwest Bali.  Along with co-founders SYSTEMIQ and Borealis, Project Stops strategic partners include the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nova Chemicals, Nestlé, Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Borouge.Plastic recovery capacity: We collect all the plastic waste generated. We sort it and based on our capture rate (40-70% - depending on facility) and our available markets we sell the plastic to aggregators. In Indonesia, a city of 100k people produce annually ~1,500 tons of plastics. Our aim is to achieve >90% collection coverage within 2 years.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.708016+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.708016+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.stopoceanplastics.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_042.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_42_logo.jpeg	\N
43	ReCleanSea: Industrial solutions for ocean plastics collection & recycling	2018	79	Non-Profit Org	Development	f	contact@recleansea.org	national	{}	ReCleanSea is a non-profit organisation that is developing a unique system designed to clean up, on an industrial level, large polluted regions where floating plastic trash has accumulated with currents, winds or waves in rivers, estuaries or coastal areas. Leveraging 15+ years of experience collecting trash and heavy oil at sea and in freshwaters with small to mid-size collectors, they are building a massive apparatus. They leverage their founders 20-year experience in designing, building and operating industrial systems to tow extra-wide underwater imaging tools, as well as oil and plastic trash collectors, like the 150 small ones that the French Navy uses to protect the French coasts from oil spills.The trash collectors can be anchored in rivers or estuaries, or towed by one or two fishing or work boats in any area, after a simple half-day training session. As such, they can benefit any local community all over the world.Their proof of concept consists in building an extra-wide collector, to be towed by an existing ship, itself modified to accommodate an onboard plastic treatment unit for sorting the trash and possibly testing some recycling features. Their XXL collector is scalable, thanks to parts that are 100 m wide each, which allows it to reach 500 m in width and 700 m in length.Towed by the ship in various sea conditions during their test campaign, the extra-wide collector will sweep a large area polluted with ocean plastics. Plastic debris will accumulate in the filtering net at the tip of the collector, which is pulled back to the ship when full. Once onboard, the filtering net will be emptied onto the ship, and the plastic will be sorted and processed for recycling, while the filtering net will return to sea for another sweep.The collectors have never caught any fish in 15 years of operation. When they are towed, its at the very slow speed of 2 knots, which gives fish plenty of time to feel the draft and move away, especially as the immersed skirts of the collector are not deep. When the collectors are anchored in a river, they also let any marine life escape the current towards the filtering net.Founding partners have contributed to a starting budget to promote the project and look for investors. They are in talks with different public and private entities, internationally, to wrap their budget.They estimate the cost of the extra-wide collector alone at €800K. Adding the cost of research and studies, of modifying the ship to accommodate a treatment unit and of course the cost of the test campaign at sea, they have budgeted €5M for the proof of concept.As for any trash collection and recycling process, they believe in a combination of two main factors to make this a sustainable business model:There is a specific market for recycled ocean plastic as a raw material, with higher value than land plastic.Considering the actual cost of plastic pollution, loss of revenues from fisheries and tourism, and serious damages to the environment, they believe that ocean plastic recovery, even subsidised, is a matter of survival for natural ecosystems and mankind.They aim to build the collector in 2019 and have the test campaign at sea in 2019-2020.They are looking for partners and investors to support the first series of tests of the proof of concept and to support the association.

Their vision is to create highly scalable, circular economies for plastics in river communities which are known to be the biggest contributors of ocean plastic pollution—starting with the Ganges basin. The Renew Oceans strategy leverages science, technology, and human capital to achieve their ambitious goals. Their inaugural project, Renew Ganga, is the centerpiece of their efforts to divert ocean-bound plastics in India, empowering local women and others in Varanasi to help protect rivers and oceans from plastic pollution.Renew Oceans aims to solve the problem of plastic pollution by using an integrated approach toward collection planning, conversion technology, and community engagement.Renew Oceans is focused on the collection of both hard and soft plastics through both river- and land-based methods, leveraging innovative technologies including ReFences and Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs). They have implemented conversion of traditionally low value film and flexible plastics via RenewOne into renewable fuel to address the lack of end markets for soft plastics. Lastly, their community engagement campaigns foster changes in longstanding habits and perceptions. Renew Oceans works with students and community leaders, and their empowerment of and financial incentives for women waste pickers, builds momentum and drives adoption of new behaviors.Renew Oceans' initiatives are sponsored by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste with support from Happy Family Organics. In their first year, over 100,000 pounds of waste was diverted from the Assi River tributary, and more than 1,000 community members were engaged. In 2020, they aim to double that, diverting over 200,000 pounds of waste and engaging 10,000 members of the community in their work.Governments, NGOs, waste collection & disposal companies, and bioenergy companies are potential clients.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.771466+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.771466+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.renewoceans.org/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_044.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_44_logo.jpg	\N

Working together with fishermen in the collection of all sorts of plastic polluting the bottom of our oceans, Seaqual then transform PET into high quality yarn that goes straight into fabrics and clothing. Dealing with the inconsistency of the debris removed by the fishermen that results from exposure to sun, salt and water, required many months of investment in R&D. They are now able to create a 100% recycled polyester filament of the highest quality.Collecting debris directly from the sea, not the beaches or the coast make this project absolutely unique in its proposal. For collecting the plastic waste, more than 400 boats and 1500 Fishermen from the Spanish Mediterranean coast are involved in the project. Garbage caught in the fishermens nets is collected every day and taken to different ports. The waste is collected weekly, they are classified and categorized so that each material (aluminum, glass, pet plastic,) goes to its unique recycling chain. The PET Plastic is accumulated for conversion into flakes and later into polymer. The polymer can be used to make fabrics and then garments and thus completing the cycle.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.835575+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.835575+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	http://www.seaqual.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_046.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_46_logo.png	\N

48	The Blue Barriers: Collecting plastic waste in rivers before it reaches the sea	\N	83	Startup	Pilot	t	\N	national	{}	Description: Since the beginning of the development of our technology, we have been in search of a simple solution.  To offer a permanent solution that can be scalable in so many different conditions, including where resources are limited simplicity represents high value. That is why we worked to keep the Blue Barriers simple to build, to be installed and to maintain. The structure is made by two parts: floating modules (made of recycled and recyclable polyethylene) and a supporting internal steel structure that makes the barriers rigid and able to resist to challenging river conditions thanks to three steel cable that cross the barriers. We consider several anchorage and mooring system options to adapt at the specific river; however, in case of rivers of a width below 50m we consider an anchorage above the river level, via steel cables. This allows avoiding creating any obstacle in the river flow. In wider rivers, we will choose anchorage in the river bad (deadweights or piles). Images that describes the Blue Barriers structure will be emailed to the address below. The area where the material will be collected will be along the riverbank in order to facilitate the removal of the material also in case of balky debris like logs. The collection area will be equipped by a steel grid that will screen the material, keep an active water flow that will drive the material toward the collection point and when specifically sized will allow the passage of biological components like fish eggs and other water organisms that might float.The system will be equipped with an automatic and manual opening system that will allow disengaging the barriers in case of emergency. The manual system provides a backup of the automatic one and the option of opening the barriers in case of forecasted exceptional floodings.The structure does not require energy to function ones installed. The only energy required will be for the collection of the debris with a mechanical arm with a crab or conveyor belt.The Blue Barriers have been developed with a modular design to fit any size of river, canal or water stream and for minimizing the cost of production, transportation and maintenance.Scientific studies report that a relevant portion of the plastic transported by the rivers accumulated below the water level in the first 50cm of the water column. That is why we designed the barriers in order to sink from 70 to 90 cm.Possible challenges will be the case of the transportation of abundant balky debris (logs, branches etc.). The Barriers structure will be sized to resist to such balky debris and the disengagement systems will be activated in case of exceptional quantities of wood transported.The simplicity of the structure, also, allows us to produce locally the barriers in the country where they will be installed, creating jobs locally and minimizing the environmental footprint of transportation.Plastic recovery capacity: The quantity of plastic collected will depend on the rivers where we will install our solution. Considering the estimate of plastic transported by the 20 most polluted rivers in the world (Lebreton et al, 2017), if we would install our barriers we would collect 1.19Mton of plastic per year.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.907171+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.907171+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://seadefencesolutions.com	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_048.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_48_logo.png	\N
49	The Great Bubble Barrier: A proven concept to reduce river plastics and an elegant bubbly solution to a worldwide problem.	2015	170	Startup	Scale up	f	\N	national	{}	The founders of The Great Bubble Barrier believe plastic waste can be caught before it reaches the oceans.Too much of the waste that our society produces ends up in the water, where it damages marine and human life. Sea turtles and fish get caught up in plastic, ships are obstructed in their paths, and micro plastics form a health hazard for the smallest to the largest organisms. Plastic soup is recognized as an international problem more and more, by both the public, municipalities, government and the European Union. The current solutions that stop waste in the rivers have two major drawbacks unfortunately; they block ship traffic and/or hinder fish movement.The Great Bubble Barrier team searched for an elegant solution that blocks waste in the river, but also allows the passage of fish and ships. They arrived at a very simple idea: a barrier of bubbles.The Great Bubble Barrier offers a solution for different problem-owners: it can help governments meet changing regulation on waste management in waterways, but also help cities fight plastic problems in their waters and help waterboards to save on their cleanups after high water. The three co-founders of the Great Bubble Barrier, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, all have a big passion for sailing and nature. This is what inspired them to look for a fitting solution to the plastic soup, both fish & ship friendly.They have successfully run pilots in partnership with Deltares, Rijkswaterstaat & BAM / VandenHerik,  and are supported by sustainable & offshore organizations like Sustainable Young 100, Our Oceans Challenge, By The Ocean We Unite and the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Bubble Barrier intercepts 1 mm plastics in rivers and canals, and the team will further explore the possibilities and impact of our Bubble Barrier on microplastics coorperating with a research consortium formed by PWN (a drinking water company), KWR (research institut) and Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier (HHNK - water management board). This consortium is starting a study to prevent microplastics from purified wastewater from flowing into surface water. With this, the consortium is taking a step towards clarifying the nature of the cause and reducing the occurrence of microplastics in surface water as they can pose a threat to people and the environment.The new Bubble Barrier installed in Wervershoof will give an insight into the physical effect of the Bubble Barrier on microplastics with a size of 0.5 mm to 0.02 mm.As 8 of the 10 most polluted rivers in the world, are located in Asia, the team want to bring The Great Bubble Barrier there as soon as possible and are hoping to start there in a couple of years from now. The first steps, and contacts have been made.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.935445+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.935445+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://thegreatbubblebarrier.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_049.gif	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_49_logo.png	\N
50	The Litter Gitter: Efficient and low impact litter collection device in rivers and shallow waters	2017	253	Startup	Scale up	f	\N	national	{}	Osprey Initiative, LLC is an environmental contractor providing tailored solutions to the global challenge of litter in our waters. Their mission is to bridge the gap between intent and action in the sustainability world by bringing and implementing realistic solutions to clients, partners and communities.Osprey is the owner of the Litter Gitter, a patented small stream litter collection device used to intercept floating litter from stormwater runoff. Intial tests indicate an 80+% success rate in preventing the downstream loss of floating litter. Osprey handles all aspects of installing and maintaining the Litter Gitter. Litter is separated from vegetative debris and recyclables are separated from the regular trash.As litter or debris floats down the waterway, it encounters the floating boom system, which is anchored in the embankment and attached to the Litter Gitter device. As litter hits these booms, the litter flows naturally into the trap where it waits until it is removed by the Osprey field crews for sorting, recycling, and data collection. The data from the captured litter provides a litter profile for each watershed that can be used to inform, develop, and implement source-targeted solutions. Data collection can be tailored to the specific requirements for a particular project, study, or grant. Quantities are recorded and results are reported on a quarterly basis for inclusion in MS4 reporting if needed.Osprey Initiative heavily emphasizes an approach that is low-tech, high-touch, and environmentally-friendly. They utilize kayaks, rubber waders, shallow draft mud boats, and a hands-on team, to remove harmful litter from the environment without negatively impacting the natural landscape and habitats. Osprey's goal is to manufacture the Litter Gitters using the aluminum collected by their river cleanup efforts. Another specialty service includes tactical cleanups of small and shallow waterways. Their methods range from walking in hip boots to canoes/kayaks to shallow draft mudboats to skiffs. Their cleanups are focused on causing a minimal impact to the natural environment and simple methods, even if they require some additional labor. They also provide safety and logistical support to community-based clean-ups.The company recently launched a product line that includes the Trash Stash, a wired cube or tower that securely stores litter you may find along your route. This product is designed to fit anywhere; secure them in the back of a truck bed, attached to a bike, or in a boat (motorized or not). They closed with a secured bungee cord, so it's always easy to throw litter right in, but secure enough to keep it there until it's time to empty. With every purchase of an Osprey product, 10% of the gross revenue goes right back into funding litter clean-ups.Whether they are deploying a Litter Gitter or conducting a systematic cleanup of a particular watershed, Osprey wants to leave an impact of environmental positivity and displays that passion in all facets of their company.  This solution is unique in that it aims to capture litter further upstream and closer to source points and can be affordably scaled to deploy several devices at key intercept locations on shallow waters and unique river bends. If there is a river or shallow body of water near you flooded with litter, contact the Osprey team about installing and managing a Litter Gitter! Currently cleaning up several rivers across the Southeast United States, this team continues to grow with new partnerships. As of April 2020, Osprey Initiative has 30 Litter Gitters in 11 watersheds, with more to come in the Summer of 2020.

51	The Litterboom Project: River project to prevent plastic from reaching the oceans	2017	288	Non-Profit Org	Pilot	f	cam@thelitterboomproject.com	national	{}	The Litterboom Project is an initiative by Parley, that works on a solution to stop the flow of marine plastic waste.Approximately  90 percent of the plastic that causes marine pollution comes from river systems. Therefore the project aims to work on the preventive solutions by targeting the river systems instead of dealing with only oceans.The project stops the flow of plastic in the river systems and other local water sources using large, sealed, and robust pipes known as Litterbooms. The pipes are anchored across the river and it acts as a catchment for all surface-level plastics, which mostly consist of HDPE and PET. Each site consists of two to three Litterbooms. Keeping the storm and heavy rain in mind, the pipes are designed in a manner that under strain it only breaks from one side, preventing the loss of entire Litterboom when rivers rise. The preventive measure is set up strategically in a way that the team can collect most of the waste, sort, and send the plastic off for recycling. The project has successfully prevented 250 000 kgs of plastic from reaching the ocean in the past 2 years. This is done by engaging people from the local community. It has partnered with Parley, Tufbag, Wildlands, Astore Keymak, Fine Metals, and Cape Bulk Bags.The project is currently operating in five River systems around Durban, as well as 2 major river systems in Cape Town and aims to develop sustainable models that can be used throughout South Africa as well as Globally in the future.It benefits the communities, industries, government, and environment.	2021-04-05 07:08:07.993779+00	2021-04-05 07:08:07.993779+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.thelitterboomproject.com/about	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_051.jpeg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_51_logo.jpeg	\N

They aim to remove the plastic out of water, in high density areas (coasts, estuaries) before it breaks down into microplastic, and the chemicals leach out, harming the marine life and people. They also want to decrease the large amounts of plastic waste in the oceans.The boat that will be used is called Manta, as it draws its inspiration from the mantis, and its large mouth. The Manta is meant for operations in open sea. It will be a floating factory that collects, sorts, compacts and stores plastic waste. Mantas will have three collecting treadmills between the hulls of the ship to scoop up big quantities of plastics. By compacting the waste, the Manta will be able to accommodate large quantities of waste and is estimated to hold 250 tons of waste. This will then be carried back to land and forwarded to relevant recycling centers. Besides cleaning the oceans, this project aims to conduct scientific observation, and involve itself in prevention of pollution, in education and achieving a circular economy.The MANTA is based on the most advanced technologies in terms of clean energy, design, naval architecture, waste collection and treatment at sea. However, this is still work in progress, and they want more partners who will get involved and help in improving the design of the boat. The company is also looking for technical and financial partners to take the project forward. Feasibility studies have been carried out for eighteen months and a model ship is nearly ready.Sea Cleaners was founded in 2016 by Yvan Bourgnon, a French Swiss explorer, and is based in France.

55	Trash Wheel	\N	253	Established Company	In market	t	\N	national	{}	Description: Storm sewers and feeder streams carry trash-laden runoff to rivers that flow to harbors, bays, and oceans. The Trash Wheel harnesses renewable energy to collect and remove trash and debris from a flowing waterway. Containment booms funnel the floating trash and debris to a conveyor.  A waterwheel provides mechanical power to the conveyor using energy from the river current and solar powered pumps.  The trash is lifted by the conveyor and deposited into a dumpster. The conveyor and waterwheel are mounted on a floating platform that is held in place by pilings.  The dumpster is located on a separate barge, which is pushed by a service vessel to a transfer point for disposal.  A covering structure over the conveyor and dumpster prevents trash from being blown by the wind, protects the equipment, and provides a support structure for the photovoltaic panels. The covering structure is adapted to the specific location to optimize the power generation by the solar panels.  The machine also features an internet based remote control and monitoring system which uses cameras to monitor the trash flow and the dumpster level as well as web based controls which allow the pumps to be turned on or off from a smart phone or a computer from anywhere the internet is available.  Our flagship model in Baltimore collects trash and debris from the Jones Falls River, the largest tributary to the citys Inner Harbor.  Its floating platform is 50 long by 24 wide and constructed of quarter inch epoxy coated steel.  The waterwheel is 14 in diameter and constructed of precision cut galvanized steel.  The 36 long conveyor is submerged to a depth of 2 feet at the upstream end; and fills a 15-18 cubic yard roll-off dumpster.  The solar power is generated from a 3 kilowatt array and powers 9 pumps capable of moving more than 25,000 gallons per hour.

Not only does it add to the growing pollution levels across the world, but also endangers marine and human lives, who are dependent on oceans for their living. Marine pollution also affects the livelihood of fishermen, through reduced fishing opportunities.The Fishing for Litter project was initiated by KIMO International at a single port in the Netherlands, and it has grown and spread across Europe. European Organisations such as OSPAR have endorsed the program and encourages its 15 member countries to take part in it actively, as a part of its Regional Action Plan against marine litter.The Fishing for Litter team provides fishing vessels with large bags to collect plastics and other debris from the oceans, which gathers in their nets during their fishing activities.When the fishing boats return to port, they offload the collected waste to Fishing for Litter volunteers who either recycle the waste or dispose it suitably.The goal of the Fishing for Litter team is to promote cleaner seas, cleaner beaches, and a better marine environment for all marine lives and humans.More than 1,000 fishing vessels are now involved in this project from 8 countries across Europe and 450 tonnes of plastic and other waste was recovered from the oceans in 2016-17.Encouraged by the response of this initiative, the EU has revised its Port Reception Facilities Directive to make a special provision and space for the Fishing for Litter project.

60	Ho'ola One: A power tool that collects the small waste accumulated on the Kam ilo beach	\N	42	Academic Institution	Pilot	f	info@hoolaone.com	national	{}	Ho'ola one works towards removing microplastics from the environment of the beach. Twelve engineering students at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec built a machine for the organization that isolates plastic pieces from the sandy beaches. For several years, the plastic waste that ends on Kamilo Beach has been breaking down into increasingly fine particles. Through the years the Hawai'i Wildlife Fund has managed to dump the bulky debris, but it's the small stuff left behind buried in the sand, that's the remaining problem. Animals confuse plastic particles with insects or other living organisms and ingest them. Plastic therefore enters the food chain and poisons it. The Ho'ola One project team aims to help combat this problem.At University of Sherbrooke, twelve mechanical engineering students have been devoted to this major design project for the last two years of their degree. Leatherman, an aquatic biologist and President of the Hawai'i Wildlife Fund, believes the 'Ho'ola One' - a sand like vacuum designed by Canadian engineering students, is the solution. The machine has a big vacuum that collects the mix of sand and plastics, once the sand is dropped into a water tank, the sand sinks and the plastic floats. The machine works by separating the plastic parts from sand using the density of the diverse components. The plastic pieces are often too small to be handpicked, however with the help of the machine the minute plastic particles are picked.The device has removed roughly 230-pounds of micro-plastics at Kamilo Point (in Hawaï) in a matter of days.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.263683+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.263683+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://hoolaone.com/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_060.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_60_logo.png	\N

Ashored is currently developing a rope on-command (ROC) fishing system to minimize the risk of whale entanglements and trap loss/damage, while allowing fishers to fish in zones closed to fixed fishing gear. Marine animal entanglements and ghost fishing are creating huge issues in oceans. Entanglements are the leading cause of death for North Atlantic Right Whales and 83% of the population has visible scars from fishing gear entanglement. To remedy this, Ashored is developing new fishing systems to allow fishing to continue while creating safer conditions for whales.Ashoreds underwater buoy/rope releases work with existing lobster/crab traps/trawl lines and allow for said gear to be activated via acoustics (or a backup timer) to the surface. Once the buoy and connecting rope rise to the surface, fishermen can use existing onboard equipment and processes to retrieve the gear and prepare it for redeployment. Ashoreds ROC fishing systems include a rope containment and release module (MOBI) that also uses sensors to collect and transmit data to an onboard gear tracking system (ATLAS). ATLAS consists of Ashoreds ATLAS+ software and smart tagging to reduce gear loss and allow fishers to automate the tracking of gear and logging of catch information.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.677059+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.677059+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://ashored.ca/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_069.jpeg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_69_logo.jpeg	\N
63	Planet Patrol App: Paddleboarding for a cause: to rid our waterways of plastic pollution	2016	83	Non-Profit Org	Pilot	f	\N	national	{}	Planet Patrol is a charity with an aim to rid the inland waterways of intense plastic pollution, using the collaborative power of community action coupled with the use of disruptive technology to acquire data for research in developing sustainable alternatives.Plastic pollution is becoming an increasingly critical crisis, upsetting food chains and disrupting entire ecosystems. By 2050, the weight of plastic dumped in the ocean is projected to be twice the weight of all the fish and marine life living in it. Single-use plastic is a major source of the plastic crisis, with a mere 1% of single-use plastic bags being returned for recycling and with an average life cycle of just 12 minutes. Inland waterways are usually the origin for dumping waste plastic, which travels and find their way into the oceans. Planet Patrol launched to tackle this environmental catastrophe by organising community-driven clean-ups and collecting data on plastic pollution data using the Planet Patrol App. Every clean-up brings communities together, where waste is seen, photographed, shared on the app and cleared away; serving an equivocal purpose of helping the environment and acquisition of data. The data collected is used for scientific research into waste that escapes into nature, and helps stop the pollution at the first point of contact with the environment. The Planet Patrol app is a real-world tool that provides a platform for data collection and sharing along with community interaction; done by combining the power of citizen science and scientific analysis. The app will enable Planet Patrol to record and analyze data to conduct the world's largest survey of inland plastic pollution, with the River Thames in London alone carrying 18 tonnes of plastic. The users are required to categorize each piece by type and brand before uploading the photos. The app also aids in building a worldwide community of environmentally aware individuals, actively working towards eliminating plastic from our waterways through a collaborative effort. Nearly 300,000 pieces of plastic have been logged from over 80 countries using the #PlanetPatrol App, having intercepted 440 tonnes of plastic waste from inland waterways; that is equivalent to 15 million water bottles. They also organise corporate clean-ups and workshops to accelerate the process of eliminating single-use plastics and embed sustainability in workplaces.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.384376+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.384376+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://planetpatrol.co/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_063.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_63_logo.png	\N

65	Safegear: Partnership to fight ghost gear	2010	83	Non-Profit Org	Research	f	info@bluemarinefoundation.com	national	{}	The Blue Marine Foundation (BLUE) is a charity dedicated to creating marine reserves and establishing sustainable models of fishing. Blue's aim is to put 10% of the worlds oceans under protection by 2020 and 30% by 2030. They also work to establish sustainable fisheries so fish stocks can begin to recover.Over-fishing represents a major food security issue and has devastating consequences for the fragile biodiversity of our planet. Around 90% of global fish stocks are fully or over-exploited and around 90% of large fish are gone. The consequences are far-reaching, not only for the future of food for a growing global population, but because healthy oceans absorb half the CO2 we produce, this led them come up with The Blue Marine Foundation.Every year, an estimated 640,000 tons of fishing gear is lost in the oceans around the world. Safegear offers a simple solution to stop this plastic pollution.Beacons are being designed to fit onto existing fishing gear markers that normally comprise of a float, bamboo pole, and flag. It allows fishing vessels to inexpensively monitor their gear at sea, receive alerts if the gear starts to move, and contact vessels in the area. If gear is lost due to towing or bad weather, the beacon allows the fishing vessel to track the gear and recover it.These electronic beacons will also allow the fishing gear markers to be viewed on the bridge, wheelhouse and cockpit plotters of other marine traffic so they can avoid the hazard. Existing markers are almost impossible to see at night and often difficult in daylight.The Blue Marine Foundation has won various awards and recognitions -In 2014 BLUE won NGO of the Year in the PEA (People Environment Achievement) Awards in recognition that it was getting results where they matter most. In 2015 BLUE won four PEA Awards as part of the GB Oceans Coalition including Overall Champion.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.577899+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.577899+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_065.jpg	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_65_logo.jpg	\N
66	SeaChange: Converting ocean plastics to inert, non-toxic glass safe for marine life	\N	253	Non-Profit Org	Prototype	f	media@theseachange.org	national	{}	SeaChange is seeking to solve the marine plastics problem and create an end game for ocean plastics.Only 9% of the 400 million tons of plastic produced globally each year is recycled. Much of that unrecycled plastic ends up in oceans with approximately one dump truck load of plastic is put into the ocean every minute. When exposed to the sun, these plastics can degrade into harmful microplastics. SeaChange wants to act before this can happen and stop the pollution cycle by removing plastics from the waste stream.Using a plasma enhanced melter (PEM), SeaChange wants to collect ocean plastics and convert them into a non-toxic, inert glass that is safe for humans and marine life. The PEM breaks down the molecular structure of plastics at temperatures up to 18,000°F. The process converts 5 tons of plastic a day into clean syngas and glass. The syngas can be used for fuel. SeaChange plans on utilizing the PEM technology on ships that can be deployed in areas with a large amount of plastic waste.Phase 1 of their mission is focused on deploying SeaChange ships in the Indonesian archipelago where 1.42 million tons of plastic leak into the ocean every year. SeaChange utilizes InEnTec's PEM system.	2021-04-05 07:08:08.611457+00	2021-04-05 07:08:08.611457+00	\N	\N	APPROVED	https://theseachange.org/	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_066.PNG	https://storage.googleapis.com/akvo-unep-gpml/images/technology_66_logo.jpeg	\N
