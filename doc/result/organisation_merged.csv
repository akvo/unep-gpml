Others have advocated for boycotts of products and bans of various single use applications that routinely show up in the waste stream. Some have worked on consumer behavior. Others have worked on the role of packaging.
The Ocean Foundation will pursue science-informed national legislation in plastic-producing countries to require reengineering of the chemistry of plastic itself, redesigning of plastic products, and limiting what is made from plastic.

The Clean Europe Network is currently developing two litter monitoring systems. One methodology monitors and measures litter, littering and litter items on land, having been tested in a pilot-programme involving 10 European countries in 2016. While for the second system a pre-pilot scheme was set up last year, run on 4 locations in 4 EU countries. It monitors land based litter sources into fresh water pathways, which eventually carry litter items to the ocean. Both methodologies aim to assist local authorities or individuals to assess, monitor, measure and reduce local litter occurrences or litter sources, while, if used on a greater scale, producing comprehensive and comparable data on an European level. However, though these two monitoring systems in development current purpose focus on the EU, they could in due course be adapted and used in other parts of the world. The Clean Europe Network hopes to share this experience and expertise in the future. We anticipate to learn from the experiences of other parties by participating in the GPML and hope to be able to contribute with the experience and knowledge, which the 16 litter prevention organisations, making up the Clean Europe Network, could bring to this project.","Litter prevention /information /communication, litter measurement & monitoring, environmental quality, environmental quality auditing, Litter Clean-up activities, Litter prevention and management policy",APPROVED,

Kystlotteriet is a project, currently under the framework of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, but in the process of becoming its own organization. Our focus area is to provide infrastructure and incentives for on-going voluntary coastal clean-up trough an innovative lottery model. The project is based on cooperation between multiple stakeholders working together to save the ocean from marine litter. Local and national businesses donate prizes, local governments provide (voluntary) funding as well as designated pick up and drop off spots for gear and litter, volunteers pick litter along the coast and join in the lottery for the chance to win prizes in local and national drawings. Through our cooperation with local actors we can guarantee permanent access to gear (garbage bags, gloves etc..) and we make sure that the garbage is being picked up by local renovation companies. What Kystlotteriet is doing is essentially lowering the threshold for voluntary action, ensuring that anyone can contribute to an important cause and in that way building a culture of ownership to nature. In addition to serving as a permanent infrastructure for volunteers wishing to contribute to cleaning up the shoreline, we at Kystlotteriet organize clean-up events where we provide transportation by either buss or boat, clean-up gear, guidance as well as food and drinks. Our organization is growing fast and we are currently anchored in 50 Norwegian and 4 Danish municipalities, organizing over 30 clean-up events during the summer of 2018. One garbage-bag equals one lottery ticket, during 2017 we had over 6000 tickets contributing to removing 40 tones of marine litter from our shoreline.

Plastic Odyssey is the name of our ship that will set sail in 2020 aiming the most polluted coasts of the world. Plastic waste will be collected on the beaches, at the shore and in the surrounding towns and transformed into materials and objects for local use (slabs, bricks, etc.), through the use of low cost technologies embarked on the boat. Non recyclable plastic waste will be oriented towards energy production. The process used is pyrolysis to convert plastic into fuel to power the boat. The vessel will be a complete floating workshop integrating sorting, recycling and energy recovery technologies. Based on short loops, Plastic Odyssey is also a model of cooperation that aims at making local people aware of the value of plastic waste: turning waste into a resource by leaning on local waste pickers, micro-entreprise of recycling, ragmen … and allowing the professionalisation of informal sector through low technologies free of patent, easy to build, and durably used by local entrepreneurs and artisans.

campaigns on solid waste, its impacts on ecosystems, and human health on the island of Roatan. 
Throughout the 2018-2019 periods, the solid waste project consisted of influencing public policies on solid waste 
management, strengthening recyclers, and motivating a change in behavior towards the use of single use plastics. 
This was done through an annual race “Acropora” in which the moto was “If you want to enjoy Roatan you must use 
less plastic” (in spanish “Si de Roatan quieres gozar, menos plástico debes usar), participants received the running 
kit which also included products to replace single use plastics, such as stainless steel reusable water bottles, 
sporks and bamboo straws. 
A Roots & Shoots campaign was also conducted in five schools promoting good management of solid waste through
building awareness to students and parents through informational talks, separation centers, hands-on activities. 
Furthermore, a ban on single use plastics was proposed through change.org, signatures in the communities, and 
during the race. During the project the ordinances banning plastic bags, plastic straws, plastic bottles (PET) and 
foam in the municipality of Roatán were approved. BICA began its citizen science program in 2018, consisting of a 
drift card study and brand audits in community beaches around the island of Roatan to collect data on waste.  
This data was very valuable for the local municipality in 2019 when the bans came into effect.  
It was clear the majority of waste collected during the brand audits was plastic, 36% collected being PET bottles 
and 16% collected the tops of bottles.
In 2020, BICA started a research in microplastic in the digestive system of lionfish which is still going on and, 
it will continue in animals found beached and commercial fish caught by artesanal fishermen.","Reducing levels and impacts of land-based litter and solid waste introduced into the aquatic environment.
