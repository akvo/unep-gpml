    "challenge_and_solution": "Plastic pollution poses a threat both to humans and the environment of Costa Rica. Several industries, including fisheries and tourism, are threatened by improper disposal of plastics. The problem was exacerbated when China closed its borders to plastic waste imports, resulting in a quick build-up of plastic waste. This crisis catalyzed Costa Rica to launch an initiative to eliminate single-use plastics in most municipalities and businesses by 2021.<br/><br/> This encompasses regulations targeting Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), requiring “waste producers” to develop, implement, and follow waste management and collection programs. The regulation of single-use plastics covers restrictions for plastic bags, straws, polystyrene containers and single-use plastic water bottles. In addition, a directive was passed to implement information campaigns and label single-use plastics based on a newly adopted classification tool, distinguishing between “Renewable, Compostable, and Compostable” and other types.",

Belize imports and produces large amounts of single-use plastic bags and Styrofoam and plastic food containers and intended to address this by developing an action plan on marine litter. This plan should also cover a national marine litter monitoring programme, in order to provide data on the amounts of single-use plastics that end up in the environment.<br/><br/> The action plan was developed through extensive stakeholder engagement and supported by a series of policy papers. Stakeholder workshops identified gaps and actions related to policy, stakeholder coordination, waste management and auditing, outreach and scientific knowledge. A total of 25 marine litter actions were identified, providing a framework for all sectors to coordinate and tackle the marine litter problem.",

The law’s principle of shared responsibility assigns the duty to implement reverse logistics between manufacturers, importers, distributors, consumers and local authorities.<br/><br/> The law mandates that waste pickers should be prioritized in waste management systems, both through involvement in selective collection as well as sorting and reselling packaging materials. Corporate producers have formed partnerships with organized waste picker cooperatives. The current system allows waste picker cooperatives greater access to capital, which is critical to build capacity. However, serious power inequities remain between private waste producers and waste picker cooperatives, and it will be important to ensure fair remuneration, as well as the inclusion of municipalities and individual waste pickers in the reverse logistics process.",

Inspired by new legislation at the EU and nationally which set ambitious recycling targets, the authorities of Sălacea committed to starting their journey towards Zero Waste.<br/><br/> A complete door-to-door separate collection system was developed and implemented for five waste streams. Waste prevention was encouraged through the creation of an urban mining centre, facilitating the collection, repair, reuse and recycling of resources. As a financial incentive, citizens were given the choice to opt-in or out of a new tax for local waste management services. Citizen engagement was further supported by the implementation of a comprehensive four weeks education programme and a strong communication strategy to engage the community. As a result, recycling not only increased from almost zero to 40% in 3 months, but also the overall waste generation dropped by 55%.",

This method uses very high geospatial resolution imagery captured by drones to quickly collect data from large areas in a short time. Two machine learning components process the captured images and allow for plastic litter detection, plastic litter quantification, and waste type classification.

However, scientific knowledge on marine plastic litter and effective countermeasures remains insufficient to tackle the problem properly.<br/><br/> The CounterMEASURE project works to identify sources and pathways of plastic pollution in river systems in Asia, particularly the Mekong and the Ganges. The project has developed plastic leakage models for localities in 6 different countries using an innovative and replicable approach. Deploying technologies like GIS, machine learning and drones has allowed the CounterMEASURE team to augment ground-level research in an efficient and scalable way.

    "challenge_and_solution": "The River Ganga (Ganges) is considered to be one of the most sacred rivers in the world, but its future is threatened by human activity and continuous issues of pollution. In fact, the River Ganga has been identified as one of the 10 rivers responsible for transporting 90 per cent of plastic waste to the world’s oceans. <br/><br/> Aviral works hand in hand with local stakeholders from the cities Haridwar and Rishikesh, while being embedded in the broader plastic waste management ecosystem, to pilot an approach based on four key axes: awareness raising, capacity building, value chain and innovation. The project specifically targets waste management and circularity by promoting reuse and recycling, which should reduce the leakage of mismanaged plastic into the environment. One of the highlights of the project is supporting local innovations to combat the plastic problem and testing them at pilot scale in the two cities. Once the pilot closes in 2022, the intention is to scale up the initiatives and the lessons learnt in partner cities across India.",

    "title": "Closing the Loop: Creating new circular recycling businesses and supporting vulnerable communities",
    "challenge_and_solution": "In Accra, Ghana, only 20% of household garbage waste is collected and only 2% of the waste is recycled resulting in 78% of garbage ending up on the streets. Due to heavy rainfall, the garbage drains into the oceans. Also, plastic bags and containers often clog gutters causing hazardous flooding. <br/><br/> Closing the Loop works by supporting local entrepreneurs from vulnerable communities in Accra, by starting small recycling plants and set them up as social enterprises in communities suffering from the effects of plastic waste littering. Plastic waste is collected, processed into pellets and sold to be reused in products such as household or building materials. The social enterprise model will help create jobs and keep most of the value generated by recycling plastic in the community. The foundation also works with schools to educate and engage students in waste management and supports building career paths for young mechanics and engineers, through a partnership with the Design and Technology Institute.",

    "challenge_and_solution": "Tuvalu is aiming to transform towards a circular economy as the country sees it as the only way to address the increasing amount of waste that ends up in landfills annually. Excess waste presents a significant challenge, considering the extremely limited land mass of atoll countries such as Tuvalu. <br/><br/> The ‘Tuvalu Integrated Waste Policy and Action Plan 2017-2026’ is the main national policy framework to guide the management of waste. It consists of six goals, including strengthened institutional systems to address gaps in waste management, establishing strong public-private partnerships in the delivery of waste services and capacity building of waste practitioners. The 2019 Annual Review reports that there is evidence of “significant progress”, but that enforcement of government waste management-related legislation, regulations, and policies is “generally weak,” due to a lack public awareness and education programmes carried out thus far. The review provides recommended measures to be incorporated in the refined action plan 2017-2021.",

    "challenge_and_solution": "Since 2015, Lebanon has been suffering from a solid waste crisis. There is no serious country-wide effort to recover raw materials from the generated solid waste. The Ministry of Environment has recently developed a new Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategy. Based on this Strategy, UN-Habitat decided to test it by implementing sorting at source in 4 municipalities.<br/><br/> In addition, the Ministry of Environment is distributing eleven Reverse Vending Machines (RVM) to various physical social spaces in strategic selected cities across Lebanon in order to increase the value of recycling for the host and the user. RVMs are devices that accept used empty containers—including metal, plastic or glass—and returns call credit to the user. As a result, municipalities are involved in the sorting at source process while also raising awareness to the community as a whole.",
