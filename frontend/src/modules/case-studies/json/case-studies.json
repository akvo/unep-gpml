    "challenge_and_solution": "Plastic pollution poses a threat both to humans and the environment of Costa Rica. Several industries, including fisheries and tourism, are threatened by improper disposal of plastics. The problem was exacerbated when China closed its borders to plastic waste imports, resulting in a quick build-up of plastic waste. This crisis catalyzed Costa Rica to launch an initiative to eliminate single-use plastics in most municipalities and businesses by 2021.\n \n This encompasses regulations targeting Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), requiring “waste producers” to develop, implement, and follow waste management and collection programs. The regulation of single-use plastics covers restrictions for plastic bags, straws, polystyrene containers and single-use plastic water bottles. In addition, a directive was passed to implement information campaigns and label single-use plastics based on a newly adopted classification tool, distinguishing between “Renewable, Compostable, and Compostable” and other types.",

The law’s principle of shared responsibility assigns the duty to implement reverse logistics between manufacturers, importers, distributors, consumers and local authorities.\n \n The law mandates that waste pickers should be prioritized in waste management systems, both through involvement in selective collection as well as sorting and reselling packaging materials. Corporate producers have formed partnerships with organized waste picker cooperatives. The current system allows waste picker cooperatives greater access to capital, which is critical to build capacity. However, serious power inequities remain between private waste producers and waste picker cooperatives, and it will be important to ensure fair remuneration, as well as the inclusion of municipalities and individual waste pickers in the reverse logistics process.",

Inspired by new legislation at the EU and nationally which set ambitious recycling targets, the authorities of Sălacea committed to starting their journey towards Zero Waste.\n \n A complete door-to-door separate collection system was developed and implemented for five waste streams. Waste prevention was encouraged through the creation of an urban mining centre, facilitating the collection, repair, reuse and recycling of resources. As a financial incentive, citizens were given the choice to opt-in or out of a new tax for local waste management services. Citizen engagement was further supported by the implementation of a comprehensive four weeks education programme and a strong communication strategy to engage the community. As a result, recycling not only increased from almost zero to 40% in 3 months, but also the overall waste generation dropped by 55%.",

This method uses very high geospatial resolution imagery captured by drones to quickly collect data from large areas in a short time.

The operation removed 25 tonnes at a cost of $224,537, which equates to around $10,000 per day of clean-up operations or $8,900 per tonne of litter.

    "challenge_and_solution": "Since 2015, Lebanon has been suffering from a solid waste crisis. There is no serious country-wide effort to recover raw materials from the generated solid waste. The Ministry of Environment has recently developed a new Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategy. Based on this Strategy, UN-Habitat decided to test it by implementing sorting at source in 4 municipalities.\n \n In addition, the Ministry of Environment is distributing eleven Reverse Vending Machines (RVM) to various physical social spaces in strategic selected cities across Lebanon in order to increase the value of recycling for the host and the user. RVMs are devices that accept used empty containers—including metal, plastic or glass—and returns call credit to the user. As a result, municipalities are involved in the sorting at source process while also raising awareness to the community as a whole.",
