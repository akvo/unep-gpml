                An action plan can deliver on more than plastic pollution. It
                can aim to provide numerous co-benefits to society and the
                environment. There are also potential negative impacts to some
                sectors and members of the community. An understanding of how
                policy interventions can positively or negatively affect
                industry and society is important and requires thorough
                stakeholder engagement.

                The National Source Inventories (NSI) approach is a framework
                for national-level coordination around statistics on plastic
                production, import, and lifecycle; waste statistics; monitoring
                of freshwater and wastewater; and monitoring of costal and
                marine waters. To learn more about the NSI approach read more

                Actors are those who can help make the changes we need.
                Stakeholders are anyone with an interest or who may be affected
                positively or negatively by the measures implemented through the
                action plan. Understanding who the actors and stakeholders are
                is key to the success and ownership of the action plan.
