      "This report provides a global overview on the progress of countries in passing laws and regulations that limit the manufacture, import, sale, use and disposal of selected single-use plastics and microplastics which have a great impact in the production of marine litter. It is based on a review of national legally-binding instruments that include bans and restrictions, taxes and levies, and waste management measures to enhance disposal, encourage reuse and recycling, and promote alternatives to plastic products. The report includes three sections: 1) plastic bags, 2) other single-use plastics, and 3) microbeads. It seeks to provide a more thorough understanding of the scope and types of regulatory approaches policymakers are employing to address plastic pollution. The report should enable future research by enhancing the understanding of existing legal requirements to prevent plastic pollution at the country level.",

      "PAME, Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic (May 2021)",
    description:
      "Marine litter, particularly when made of plastic, is amongst the most pervasive problems affecting the marine environment globally (UNEP, 2009; UNGA, 2012; UNEP, 2016). Marine litter in the Arctic is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems, but also to human health and ways of life. Vital Arctic economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, and shipping can be potential sources of marine litter and be negatively impacted by it. Marine litter found on Arctic beaches, coastlines, and inland waters originates both from within the region and outside it, with regional variability. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic will enable the Arctic Council to take targeted and collective action to address this problem within the Arctic and contribute to awareness of the Arctic-specific impacts. It is focused on actions to be taken in the Arctic, by Arctic States collectively and independently, and is designed to be complementary to, and cooperative with, efforts underway in other international and regional organizations and conventions, as well as their activities and programs. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic sets out a range of Strategic Actions that address both land- and sea-based sources of marine litter in the Arctic region , organized by the following eight themes: I) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Fisheries and Aquaculture; II) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Ships and Offshore Structures; III) Improving Onshore Waste and Wastewater Management; IV) Sustainable Materials Management in the Arctic Environment; V) Cleaning Arctic Coasts; VI) Strengthening Monitoring and Research; VII) Outreach; and VIII) International Cooperation.",

The intention is to promote a more harmonised approach to the design of sampling programmes, the selection of appropriate indicators (i.e. type of sample), the collection of samples or observations, the characterisation of sampled material, dealing with uncertainties, data analysis and reporting the results and also to inform the establishment of national and regional field monitoring programmes.",
