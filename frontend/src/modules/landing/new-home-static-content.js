        description:
          "Bantam Materials International in collaboration with Oceancycle has developed a tracking system for products manufactured using certified ocean-bound plastic materials.Oceancycle provides certification for materials at bottle aggregation sites, in at-risk ocean environments, to document them through the supply chain. Bantam manufactures a product line of rPET flakes and pellets using ocean-bound plastic waste. Through the partnership, both companies aim to provide complete traceability of Bantam's rPET products using Oceancycle's certification of the materials. Ocean bound plastic is the term given to any plastic waste found within 50 km distance of ocean coastline. According to experts, an at-risk ocean area is any regional area which lacks waste management, suffers from overpopulation and where plastic pollution poses a serious threat to wildlife. Through the Certified Ocean Bound Plastic collaboration, Bantam aims to allow tracking the rPET materials back to at-risk areas such as SouthEast Asia, the Galapagos, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean. Bantam uses ocean-bound plastic to produce a line of rPET products like:PelletsFlakesBalesPreformWith Certified Ocean Bound Plastic, Bantam and Oceancycle allow tracking of materials used to make these products. Tracking is allowed at all points of the supply chain, mainly:CollectionRecyclingProduction-Ready MaterialAdditionally, the collaboration allows tracking through purchasing notes, delivery notes, scale trucks, dedicated controllers.Through the system, customers, brands, and partners can trace the materials used for the rPET products back to the at-risk ocean areas from where the plastic waste was sourced. Bantam also provides auditing and quality check services of its products ensuring compliance with standards and application requirements. The company sells its products into developed economies like those in the UK, Europe, North America, and Australia. All Bantam products are in compliance with FDA, REACH and EFSA standards.",

        description:
          "This briefing provides an overview of exports of plastic waste from the 28 EU Member States (EU-28) to other countries and discusses its possible consequences and opportunities. It  builds on a report by the EEAs European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE). Annual global plastic production has increased from 2 to 380 million tonnes since 1950 and is projected to double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. European countries lack the capacity to manage growing amounts of plastic waste in circular and sustainable ways. In early 2019, the EU exported around 150 000 tonnes of plastic waste per month. This figure was about twice as high in 2015 and 2016 - up to 300.000 tons monthly - when exports went to China and Hong Kong primarily. Import restrictions are the reason for the decrease and shift in exports of plastic waste to other countries in Asia. Poor management of plastic waste has negative environmental and climate effects, such as deposits of plastic and microplastics appearing on land and in rivers and oceans worldwide. Plastic contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions from production and from waste management, and to harmful effects from chemicals and water use. There is little knowledge or transparency about how plastic waste imported from the EU is managed in other countries. Recent restrictions on imports of plastic waste in China, combined with some types of plastic being added to the Basel Convention, is likely to further decrease EU exports. This poses the risk of increased incineration and landfilling of plastic waste in Europe. The EU must find circular and climate-friendly ways of managing its plastic waste e.g. by increasing reuse and recycling.",

The project, funded by the Sweden International Development Agency (Sida) and implemented by UN Environment Programme and COBSEA, will involve stakeholders throughout the plastic value chain, from the plastic producers to the waste managers to those in coastal communities suffering most the impacts of plastic pollution, to ensure less plastic leaks through waste management systems.To reduce waste, UN Environment and COBSEA will be working with research institutions, companies, government bodies and civil society to reduce the use of the most harmful and difficult to recycle plastic, boost collection and recycling of high-value plastic such as PET, and generate region-wide public awareness and support for better plastic pollution policies. The scientific basis for addressing marine litter will be strengthened, by collecting and analyzing data on plastic leakage and marine litter at local, national and regional levels. UN Environment, COBSEA and partners will use this baseline data to help all stakeholders in the plastic lifecycle develop evidence-based policies and plans that will reduce the amount of marine litter flowing from the region.",

A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

It is secured on both banks or one end is anchored in water as necessary. It is deployed where the stream crosses a road or has road access. The alignment ensures that the plastics and biota lies close to one bank within reach of riverbank based gear. Boats and floating gear is not required to evacuate the collection. Floating plastics, wood, biota etc is captured by this system and mesh opening size is 10 cm x 10 cm, though it can be customized.  Where boat traffic exists the alignment can allow boat movement while  arresting trash and plastics. The alignment is different in tidal streams.  We have different models for river, stream, and smaller drains.

      "PAME, Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic (May 2021)",
    description:
      "Marine litter, particularly when made of plastic, is amongst the most pervasive problems affecting the marine environment globally (UNEP, 2009; UNGA, 2012; UNEP, 2016). Marine litter in the Arctic is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems, but also to human health and ways of life. Vital Arctic economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, and shipping can be potential sources of marine litter and be negatively impacted by it. Marine litter found on Arctic beaches, coastlines, and inland waters originates both from within the region and outside it, with regional variability. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic will enable the Arctic Council to take targeted and collective action to address this problem within the Arctic and contribute to awareness of the Arctic-specific impacts. It is focused on actions to be taken in the Arctic, by Arctic States collectively and independently, and is designed to be complementary to, and cooperative with, efforts underway in other international and regional organizations and conventions, as well as their activities and programs. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic sets out a range of Strategic Actions that address both land- and sea-based sources of marine litter in the Arctic region , organized by the following eight themes: I) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Fisheries and Aquaculture; II) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Ships and Offshore Structures; III) Improving Onshore Waste and Wastewater Management; IV) Sustainable Materials Management in the Arctic Environment; V) Cleaning Arctic Coasts; VI) Strengthening Monitoring and Research; VII) Outreach; and VIII) International Cooperation.",

    description:
      "The principle purpose of this report is to provide recommendations, advice and practical guidance, for the establishment of programmes to monitor and assess the distribution and abundance of plastic litter, also referred to as plastic debris, in the ocean. The intention is to promote a more harmonised approach to the design of sampling programmes, the selection of appropriate indicators (i.e. type of sample), the collection of samples or observations, the characterisation of sampled material, dealing with uncertainties, data analysis and reporting the results and also to inform the establishment of national and regional field monitoring programmes.",

      "Breaking the Plastic Wave, a global analysis using first-of-its kind modeling, shows that we can cut annual flows of plastic into the ocean by about 80% in the next 20 years by applying existing solutions and technologies. No single solution can achieve this goal; rather, we break the plastic wave only by taking immediate, ambitious, and concerted actions.",
