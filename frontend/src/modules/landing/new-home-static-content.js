        description:
          "Bureo was founded in 2013, based in the US and Chile, is focused on finding solutions for the growing issue of plastic pollution in our oceans and initiating social change. Bureos Net+Positiva program works together with fishermen to provide a positive solution for their end of life fishing gear, which Bureo transforms into highly recyclable and durable raw materials.Headquartered in California, Bureo is a certified B-Corporation. It is a participating company in Patagonia's Tin Shed Ventures Fund, an internal fund supporting likeminded start-up companies having a positive impact on the environment.Bureo makes items from recycled fishing nets. Their recycling program in Chile, 'Net Positiva', provides fishing net collection points to keep plastic fishing nets out of our oceans. Preventing harmful materials from entering the ocean, the programs protect wildlife and supporting local fishing communities through financial incentives.Once collected, the nets are washed and prepared for a mechanical recycling process. Within this process, they are shredded and fed through a 'pelletizer', where they are melted and cut into small recycled pellets. These pellets are then injected into steel molds to form their products. Bureo is working with industry leading companies to incorporate their materials called NetPlus into their supply chains. Collaborating with organizations that are willing to go beyond industry standards, Bureo is working closely with these partners to expand and replicate responsible material solutions. Together they can create a net positive impact on our ocean environment.Some of the products they make in collaboration with different companies are:Patagonia: using Netplus for the brim stiffeners in the hatsHumanscale: The first ergonomic task chair made with recycled fishing nets.Smart Ocean Chair: Each chair incorporates almost 2 pounds of recycled fishing net material.Costa Sunglasses: The Untangled Collection has frames constructed from 100% recycled fishing nets and are fit with mineral glass lenses.Jenga Ocean: Jenga® Ocean™ & Bureo. The first board game made from recycled fishing nets. Jenga Ocean is made from over 25 square feet of nets proudly sourced through Bureo's Net Positiva recycling program.Carver Skateboards: 'The Ahi', a performance skateboard made from recycled fishing nets. Futures Fins: The first surf fins made from recycled fishing nets, Futures' Alpha line incorporates Bureo's NetPlus recycled fishing nets with Futures' Compound 6 carbon and air infused technology.They have created a positive impact since 2013, with over 185,000 kg of materials collected to date from 26 participating communities in Chile.",

        description:
          "Ocean plastic is an abundant “stranded resource” that can replace the use of virgin materials and then be recycled and reused endlessly, reversing the tide of plastics filling our oceans. They are continuously adding collection sites and types of materials offered to brands in product development. 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans annually. 80% of that comes from land based sources. Oceanworks, together with partners around the globe, is sustainably and ethically harvesting plastic from coastal areas where waste is mismanaged. The plastic they utilize is 100% recycled from this coastal harvest, thereby taking it out of its inevitable flow to the ocean. They collect plastic in many locations where there are no substantial financial opportunities available for people. Their mission is to create meaningful employment and positive local impact in these communities. Community sources - Global Impact They work with local collection partners around the world, creating meaningful employment and cleaner waterways. The Oceanworks team is a seasoned group of design and engineering professionals. They have deep manufacturing partnerships in Asia and have been at the forefront of sustainable design efforts before it was cool. They optimize design and manufacturing for efficiency and quality so that ocean plastic will be used most effectively. They can also help to source and manage suppliers. Oceanworks sourced plastic is documented from collection source to retail shelf. They follow the material and its collection source and then monitor the chain of custody all the way through to the final product. This gives brands and factories assurances that the ocean plastic was ethically collected for a living wage. They are working with leading experts in ocean debris, technical expertise on polymers, and waste management. Oceanworks was born out of Norton Point, an eyewear company that launched a line of ocean plastic sunglasses in 2016. Funded on Kickstarter in just 6 days, the project raised awareness of ocean plastic worldwide and opened our eyes to the many disparate elements that need to be woven together to develop a product that truly makes a difference. Ultimately, this realization led us to found Oceanworks.",

          "Marine litter, particularly when made of plastic, is amongst the most pervasive problems affecting the marine environment globally (UNEP, 2009; UNGA, 2012; UNEP, 2016). Marine litter in the Arctic is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems, but also to human health and ways of life. Vital Arctic economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, and shipping can be potential sources of marine litter and be negatively impacted by it. Marine litter found on Arctic beaches, coastlines, and inland waters originates both from within the region and outside it, with regional variability. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic will enable the Arctic Council to take targeted and collective action to address this problem within the Arctic and contribute to awareness of the Arctic-specific impacts. It is focused on actions to be taken in the Arctic, by Arctic States collectively and independently, and is designed to be complementary to, and cooperative with, efforts underway in other international and regional organizations and conventions, as well as their activities and programs. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic sets out a range of Strategic Actions that address both land- and sea-based sources of marine litter in the Arctic region , organized by the following eight themes: I) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Fisheries and Aquaculture; II) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Ships and Offshore Structures; III) Improving Onshore Waste and Wastewater Management; IV) Sustainable Materials Management in the Arctic Environment; V) Cleaning Arctic Coasts; VI) Strengthening Monitoring and Research; VII) Outreach; and VIII) International Cooperation.",

A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

    title: "Legal limits on single-use plastics and microplastics",
    description:
      "This report provides a global overview on the progress of countries in passing laws and regulations that limit the manufacture, import, sale, use and disposal of selected single-use plastics and microplastics which have a great impact in the production of marine litter. It is based on a review of national legally-binding instruments that include bans and restrictions, taxes and levies, and waste management measures to enhance disposal, encourage reuse and recycling, and promote alternatives to plastic products. The report includes three sections: 1) plastic bags, 2) other single-use plastics, and 3) microbeads. It seeks to provide a more thorough understanding of the scope and types of regulatory approaches policymakers are employing to address plastic pollution. The report should enable future research by enhancing the understanding of existing legal requirements to prevent plastic pollution at the country level.",

      "PAME, Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic (May 2021)",
    description:
      "Marine litter, particularly when made of plastic, is amongst the most pervasive problems affecting the marine environment globally (UNEP, 2009; UNGA, 2012; UNEP, 2016). Marine litter in the Arctic is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems, but also to human health and ways of life. Vital Arctic economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, and shipping can be potential sources of marine litter and be negatively impacted by it. Marine litter found on Arctic beaches, coastlines, and inland waters originates both from within the region and outside it, with regional variability. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic will enable the Arctic Council to take targeted and collective action to address this problem within the Arctic and contribute to awareness of the Arctic-specific impacts. It is focused on actions to be taken in the Arctic, by Arctic States collectively and independently, and is designed to be complementary to, and cooperative with, efforts underway in other international and regional organizations and conventions, as well as their activities and programs. The Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the Arctic sets out a range of Strategic Actions that address both land- and sea-based sources of marine litter in the Arctic region , organized by the following eight themes: I) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Fisheries and Aquaculture; II) Reducing Marine Litter Inputs from Ships and Offshore Structures; III) Improving Onshore Waste and Wastewater Management; IV) Sustainable Materials Management in the Arctic Environment; V) Cleaning Arctic Coasts; VI) Strengthening Monitoring and Research; VII) Outreach; and VIII) International Cooperation.",

    description:
      "The principle purpose of this report is to provide recommendations, advice and practical guidance, for the establishment of programmes to monitor and assess the distribution and abundance of plastic litter, also referred to as plastic debris, in the ocean. The intention is to promote a more harmonised approach to the design of sampling programmes, the selection of appropriate indicators (i.e. type of sample), the collection of samples or observations, the characterisation of sampled material, dealing with uncertainties, data analysis and reporting the results and also to inform the establishment of national and regional field monitoring programmes.",

No single solution can achieve this goal; rather, we break the plastic wave only by taking immediate, ambitious, and concerted actions.",
