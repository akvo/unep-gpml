              <h3>PLASTIC POLLUTION FROM SOURCE TO SEA</h3>
              <h4>Airborne - pathway</h4>
              <p>Plastic particles such as vehicle tyres,
              synthetic textiles accumulate in the
              atmosphere, where they can be
              transported over long distances. Rain, snow and wind can deposit plastics in
              different places. Microplastics are found in snow, ice
              and sea-ice, from the poles to remote
              mountain tops.
              </p>
              <h4>rivers - direct pathway</h4>
              <p>Transport of plastic debris through the environment including into oceans.</p>

              <h4>Agriculture Soil – source and sink</h4>
              <p>Use of plastic films and large fibre textiles in farming
practices. Sewage sludge with plastic residue used as
fertilizer. Irrigation with plastic contaminated water.
Artificial fertilizer and seeds coated with a polymer.</p>
              <h4>industry - source</h4>
              <p>Missing or low enforcement of regulation to restrict
pollution from pellets during production or transportation
contribute to leakage of plastics into the environment.</p>
              <h4>Cities and Waste Management - source</h4>
              <p>Clothes, synthetic products such as building materials,
take-away food containers…etc. are sources of plastic
particles and fibres. Inadequate waste management is a
source of leakage of plastic particles in the environment
including groundwater.</p>
