          <strong>WHAT IS THE GPML DIGITAL PLATFORM?</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The GPML Digital Platform is multi-stakeholder and partly open source,
          compiling and crowdsourcing different resources, integrating data and
          connecting stakeholders to guide action.

      <div>
        <h4>
          <strong>WHAT DOES THE DIGITAL PLATFORM OFFER?</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Digital Platform offers a single point of access for current,
          accurate data and information on plastic pollution, marine litter and
          related topics. It provides a wide range of materials to support
          stakeholdersâ€™ needs, ranging from scientific research to technological
          innovation and public outreach, in order to inform decision-making,
          educate and raise awareness, facilitate target setting, and advance
          cooperation. An additional feature is a virtual networking forum for
          stakeholders.

            change initiatives, education, training, events, new technologies,
            monitoring and analysis initiatives and science Initiatives.

            An action plan is a detailed plan outlining actions needed to reach

            steps that must be taken, or activities that must be performed well,
            for a strategy to succeed. Development of action plans is required
            under many multilateral environmental agreements to facilitate
            implementation.

            building abilities, relationships and values that will enable
            organisations, groups and individuals to improve their performance
            and achieve their development objectives. It includes strengthening
            the processes, systems and rules that influence collective and
            individual behaviour and performance in all development endeavours.
            And it means enhancing peopleâ€™s technical ability and willingness to
