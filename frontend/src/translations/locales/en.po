"From a statistical perspective, global community has a clear understanding that national statistical offices and other relevant agencies need guidance on how to calculate plastic statistics. With this in mind, in early 2023 UNEP and UNITAR began developing a statistical guideline on measuring flows of plastic along the lifecycle. \n"
"The outcome of this work is to provide policy-makers with high-quality statistics on plastics that are comparable at the national, regional and global levels to inform policies on responsible consumption and production, the circular economy and others.\n"
"The guideline is developed jointly by UNEP and UNITAR in collaboration with UNCTAD, UNECE, UNSD, OECD, the BRS Secretariat and many others.\n"
"The First Draft of the guideline includes 8 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the necessity of this work and how to use the guideline. Chapter 2 is a general chapter that introduces the scope and boundary of plastic lifecycle; terms and definitions; Plastic flows through the System of Environmental- Economic Accounting; and Classifications to support statistics on plastic. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are methodological chapters that elaborate the key elements in accounting for plastic supply, plastic use, and plastic waste respectively. Chapter 6 focuses on potential data sources and units of measurement. Chapter 7 provides a list of core indicators which can be built through this guideline to support policy makers, such as Plastic Production, Plastic Imports, Plastic Exports, Apparent Plastic Consumption, Plastic Waste Generated, Plastic Waste Collected, Plastic Waste Treated, and Plastic to the Environment. And Chapter 8 provides an overview of scientific approaches to plastic data. The guideline also includes annexes mainly on statistical classification groups.\n"
"A final guideline is planned to be published by the end of 2024.\n"
