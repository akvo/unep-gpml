The NSC should aim to meet 2-4 times per year to assist with and drive the roadmap/strategy/plan. A project team could be established to assist the NSC, consisting of consultants and focal points, to lead the implementation of the project with the guidance of the NSC and UNEP.</5><6>Step 2: Stakeholder consultation process</6><7>Consultation should aim to understand the current issues faced by various stakeholders, as well as their role in solving the problem (actors) and how proposed activities of the national plastics strategy may affect them positively or negatively. Different stakeholders may also have access to important data. This step of the workflow provides guidance on organizing a comprehensive stakeholder consultation process to ensure all relevant sectors and stakeholders are consulted.</7><8>Step 3: Legislation & Policy Review and Analysis</8><9>An analysis of the legal and policy framework in your country can help identify current goals and targets that the national plastics strategy should aim to achieve, as well as gaps in this framework that the strategy could help close.
