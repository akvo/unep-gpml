The NSC should aim to meet 2-4 times per year to assist with and drive the roadmap/strategy/plan. A project team could be established to assist the NSC, consisting of consultants and focal points, to lead the implementation of the project with the guidance of the NSC and UNEP.</5><6>Step 2: Stakeholder consultation process</6><7>Consultation should aim to understand the current issues faced by various stakeholders, as well as their role in solving the problem (actors) and how proposed activities of the national plastics strategy may affect them positively or negatively. Different stakeholders may also have access to important data. This step of the workflow provides guidance on organizing a comprehensive stakeholder consultation process to ensure all relevant sectors and stakeholders are consulted.</7><8>Step 3: Legislation & Policy Review and Analysis</8><9>An analysis of the legal and policy framework in your country can help identify current goals and targets that the national plastics strategy should aim to achieve, as well as gaps in this framework that the strategy could help close. This allows for identification of priority areas to track and the type of data needed to do so. In this stage, together with UNEP’s guidance, a review and analysis of the legislative and policy landscape as it pertains to marine litter and plastic pollution would be conducted.</9><10>Step 4: Data Analysis</10><11>Data is at the core of understanding the issues and current state of play, as well as the tracking of trends to determine effectiveness of the national plastics strategy. This step will help in compiling existing data and information into a State of Knowledge Report. This could include identification of areas in need of additional data collection, leading to additional secondary data collection. Note that all the data collected should be made publicly available.</11><12>Step 5: National Source Inventory Report</12><13>National plastics strategies should be underpinned by a National Source Inventory (NSI). This step will help in analyzingwe the data available and collected into a National Source Inventory Report on plastic pollution and marine litter that can inform discussions on possible actions to be included in the national plastics strategy. </13><14>Final Step: National Roadmap/Strategy/Plan</14><15>This step facilitates the development of a National Roadmap/Strategy/Plan based on the evidence and information gathered in the NSI Report.

"From a statistical perspective, global community has a clear understanding that national statistical offices and other relevant agencies need guidance on how to calculate plastic statistics. With this in mind, in early 2023 UNEP and UNITAR began developing a statistical guideline on measuring flows of plastic along the lifecycle. \n"
"The outcome of this work is to provide policy-makers with high-quality statistics on plastics that are comparable at the national, regional and global levels to inform policies on responsible consumption and production, the circular economy and others.\n"
"The guideline is developed jointly by UNEP and UNITAR in collaboration with UNCTAD, UNECE, UNSD, OECD, the BRS Secretariat and many others.\n"
"The First Draft of the guideline includes 8 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the necessity of this work and how to use the guideline. Chapter 2 is a general chapter that introduces the scope and boundary of plastic lifecycle; terms and definitions; Plastic flows through the System of Environmental- Economic Accounting; and Classifications to support statistics on plastic. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are methodological chapters that elaborate the key elements in accounting for plastic supply, plastic use, and plastic waste respectively. Chapter 6 focuses on potential data sources and units of measurement. Chapter 7 provides a list of core indicators which can be built through this guideline to support policy makers, such as Plastic Production, Plastic Imports, Plastic Exports, Apparent Plastic Consumption, Plastic Waste Generated, Plastic Waste Collected, Plastic Waste Treated, and Plastic to the Environment. And Chapter 8 provides an overview of scientific approaches to plastic data. The guideline also includes annexes mainly on statistical classification groups.\n"
"A final guideline is planned to be published by the end of 2024.\n"

The GPML Digital Platform was developed in 2021 in response to this and seeks to support transformative, multi-stakeholder actions that target the causes of pollution towards a pollution-free planet, where pollution is prevented and controlled and good environmental quality and improved health and well-being are ensured for all. Overall, the work of the GPML will support UNEP’s Medium-Term Strategy by supporting countries to deliver on their environmental commitments under international agreements."
