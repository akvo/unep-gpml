    "summary": "The ”G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter” was adopted at the G20 Hamburg Summit in 2017 and laid the foundation for the G20 members to address marine litter, the “G20 Implementation Framework for Actions on Marine Plastics Litter” facilitates further concrete actions on marine litter, especially marine plastic litter and microplastics, in line with the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter, while taking into account our own appropriate policies, approaches, and national circumstances, on a voluntary basis. This framework is expected to complement the work of the UNEP. To facilitate effective implementation of the G20 Action Plan on Marine Litter and to encourage voluntary actions by the G20 members in accordance with national policies, approaches, and circumstances, members share and continuously update information on actions and progress on marine litter. This page highlights the information shared by the government of Spain.",

The financial support from these partners was specifically provided to Green the XVI Pacific Games in partnership with the Samoan Government,  the Pacific Games Office as well as from other donor partners such as Pure Pacific Water,  Samoa Pure Water,  Zero Bags,  Voices of Athletes,  and Swire Shipping. The Greening of the Games was implemented through a Greening of the Games Committee that executed the Greening of the Games Strategy delivering on these seven initiatives: a) Improved waste management for the games facility; b) Engagement with villages in waste management measures; c) Engagement with Samoa schools in waste management measures; d) Development of awareness and media resources on marine litter,  plastics pollution and effective waste management; e) Legacy of Greening the Games through sporting champions; f) Reducing single-use plastic drinking bottles through dispensing water stations;  and g) Supporting sustainable green alternatives.",

The project aims to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting the recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to the reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air,  water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover,  the project will hold different competitions,  training and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about the adverse effect of improper waste handling.

Plastics Smart promotes “the wise use of plastics” to prevent the generation of marine litter.   Clean Ocean Material Alliance: It has become necessary for society to promote worldwide efforts to overcome the marine plastic litter issue,  a newly emerging global challenge. To decrease such litter,  conducting appropriate control of waste is urgently needed,  including through thorough efforts for preventing littering,  further enhancement of the 3Rs (Reduce,  Reuse and Recycle) initiatives involving plastic products,  and further development and adoption of plastics with excellent biodegradability and materials alternative to plastics,  for e.g.,  paper.  We established the Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance consisting of a wide range of business operators that make up the supply chain and work actively in order to accelerate innovation through public-private partnerships by promoting the 3Rs new efforts and alternative materials that make the use of plastic products more sustainable."

This has been actively promoted,  encouraging cooperation and collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders,  such as national,  local public organizations,  citizens,  NGOs,  businesses,  and research institutes. Plastics Smart promotes “the wise use of plastics” to prevent the generation of marine litter.   Clean Ocean Material Alliance: It has become necessary for society to promote worldwide efforts to overcome the marine plastic litter issue,  a newly emerging global challenge. To decrease such litter,  conducting appropriate control of waste is urgently needed,  including through thorough efforts for preventing littering,  further enhancement of the 3Rs (Reduce,  Reuse and Recycle) initiatives involving plastic products,  and further development and adoption of plastics with excellent biodegradability and materials alternative to plastics,  for e.g.,  paper.  We established the Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance consisting of a wide range of business operators that make up the supply chain and work actively in order to accelerate innovation through public-private partnerships by promoting the 3Rs new efforts and alternative materials that make the use of plastic products more sustainable.",

    "summary": "Transforming the tourism value chains to low carbon and resource efficiency requires an increase in sustainable consumption and production practices. By buying more sustainable products and services,  corporate buyers in the tourism sector can convey a strong market signal and help drive markets towards more sustainability. Following up the interactive workshop “Leveraging sustainable procurement practices to transform tourism value chains” which took place in October 2018,  UN Environment has documented successful sustainable procurement practices in a series of 16 case studies. They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics.",

    "summary": "Zwara is a costal city in Libya,  with an amazing population.  A local orgnaisation called Bado Society for the Environment was supported by the UNICEF youth programme in Zwara,  to conduct a two day campaign with activities involving 250 children,  adolescents and young people.  They were introduced to the hazards of plastic,  collected all the  plastic they could collect,  from the coast and to a certain depth in the water,  conducted interactive entertainment activities that raise the awareness on the effects of plastic on marine life,  led a competition with prizes,  and distributed tokens to all participating children and adolescents. many musicals were involved.  Kids and families were informed about the difference between plastic and its derivatives and other left overs.  In terms of the impact on marine life. the collected plastic was donated to an organisation that works with challenged people in the same city. This organisation (called Latyasoue) collects plastic and sells it to a private company for recycling and they used the money  to support purchasing wheelchairs",
