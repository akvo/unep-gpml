    "summary": "Transforming the tourism value chains to low carbon and resource efficiency requires an increase in sustainable consumption and production practices. By buying more sustainable products and services, corporate buyers in the tourism sector can convey a strong market signal and help drive markets towards more sustainability. Following up the interactive workshop “Leveraging sustainable procurement practices to transform tourism value chains” which took place in October 2018, UN Environment has documented successful sustainable procurement practices in a series of 16 case studies. They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics.",

La recolección se realizó durante 8 meses, desde mayo hasta diciembre del 2018, donde se abarcaron 2 periodos ambientales: sequía y lluvia. El tramo de recolección fue de 3 kilómetros. Para recolección del plástico se empleó la metodología del barrido, donde participaron cuadrillas de 5 estudiantes por estación, empleándose sacos de yute. Posteriormente, los desechos fueron pesados. Se recolectaron en total 760,4 kg de desechos plásticos procedentes de las 8 estaciones, de los cuales 410,4 kg corresponden a la época de lluvia y 350 kg a la época seca, con la mayor abundancia en la zona turística con 430 Kg, seguida de la zona comercial 166,8 kg y 163,6 kg en la zona poblada.

Cada zona estuvo dividida en estaciones, la zona turística 4 estaciones (playa-estuario), 2 estaciones en la zona comercial y 2 estaciones en la zona urbana. La recolección se realizó durante 8 meses, desde mayo hasta diciembre del 2018, donde se abarcaron 2 periodos ambientales: sequía y lluvia. El tramo de recolección fue de 3 kilómetros. Para recolección del plástico se empleó la metodología del barrido, donde participaron cuadrillas de 5 estudiantes por estación, empleándose sacos de yute. Posteriormente, los desechos fueron pesados. Se recolectaron en total 760,4 kg de desechos plásticos procedentes de las 8 estaciones, de los cuales 410,4 kg corresponden a la época de lluvia y 350 kg a la época seca, con la mayor abundancia en la zona turística con 430 Kg, seguida de la zona comercial 166,8 kg y 163,6 kg en la zona poblada.

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  *\tThe project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  *\tThe project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  *\tThe project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).  *\tIn Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector."

    "summary": "The project focuses on the healthcare sector in selected Sub-Saharan African countries and aims to reduce the emission of UPOPs as well as Mercury releases. The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  *\tThe project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  *\tThe project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  *\tThe project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).  *\tIn Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.",

    "summary": "The “Sea to Source: Ganges” river expeditions mobilize a global community of experts to help tackle the global problem of plastic pollution. During the expeditions, the team measures pre-monsoon and post-monsoon plastic pollution levels in the Ganges river and surrounding communities, and conducts interviews, solution workshops, and education sessions at each site. Using the data they collect, the team will work with local and national partners to inform solutions, fill knowledge gaps, and help drive a long-term positive change. The expedition (in partnership with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), the Indian Institute of Technology, the University of Dhaka, WildTeam Bangladesh, and the Isabela Foundation) also focuses on documenting how plastic waste travels from source to sea and filling the critical knowledge gaps around plastic flow, load, and composition.
