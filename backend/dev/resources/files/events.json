The global oceans manual provides guidance on how to bring together traditional monitoring techniques with new technologies and data science in order to better monitor our oceans in the context of the SDGs. The aim of the GPML Digital platform is to facilitate coordination of multi-stakeholder action towards the long-term elimination, through a life-cycle approach, of discharges of litter and microplastics into the oceans using AI capabilities, data mapping and layered functionalities including match-making.The session will review the Phase I release of the platform, discuss next steps as well as highlight opportunities to engage in the shaping of the platform through user consultations and strategic partnerships. Speakers will discuss the above topics, followed by a Q&A session.",
