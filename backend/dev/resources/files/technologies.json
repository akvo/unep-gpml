    "remarks": "Indonesia based foundation, Gringgo is a data driven trash tech startup that's works towards making smarter waste collection: a service that is more reliable, cheaper and greener and also creates more jobs and higher incomes for waste workers. More than 10,000 tons of plastics are used every day in Indonesia. 50% of Indonesians don't have waste collection so dumping into rivers is all too common. Plastic ends up in their oceans and now they are the no. 2 marine plastic polluter in the world.Gringgo initially started as CashForTrash in late 2014. Founded by a team gathered during Startup Weekend Bali 2014 at HUBUD co-working space. It was initially created as a platform for recycling aimed at local schools to make recycling easier, rewarding and fun. The concept has evolved and is now called Gringgo. Once the customers/investors buy garbage, Ginggo harvests the recyclables and sells them to factories and processors for recycling. They then share the profits with the customers/investors.People living in Bali can see on a wastemap all the locations where they can drop their recyclable waste.Users can check through Gringgo's website the list of recyclable items and the current prices. Gringgo also provides through its app a tool for residents to submit pollution complaints and issues such as illegal dumping and open burning of waste. The foundation currently handles over 340 metric tons/month of garbage and have improved recycling rates to over 35%. Their aim is to recycle over 60% of the garbage they collect and expand to other villages across Bali over the coming months.",

    "remarks": "Ichthion (previously Remora Marine) develops a cutting-edge technology to restore the ocean environment by removing plastics and synthetic waste, before they travel through the entire ocean ecosystem.Microplastics in the sea are a growing threat to human health. Almost 8 million tonnes of plastic waste enter the oceans per year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, with an exponential increase predicted over the coming years. This is a problem of unfathomable scale with far-reaching effects for wildlife and for humanity, one that makes the future of the oceans seem bleak.Born out of the laboratories of Imperial College London and the studios of the Royal College of Art, Ichthion was created with the sole purpose of restoring the ocean environment. It utilizes the latest technology and research along with a self-critical approach to innovation to ensure its solution remains effective without compromise.They have developed three types of technology streams: Azure, Cobalt and Ultramarine. These operate in different environments to prevent macro and micro plastics entering into the phytoplankton growth areas in coastal zones, and also for the reclamation of plastics in the ocean. Their systems are in Technology Readiness Level 3 (Proof of concept). The potential of their energy-generative systems to tackle the global problem of plastic pollution has been recognized by several prominent organizations through several awards and grants. For example, the Scalable Business Award by Imperial College London, two grants from Climate-KIC, the EU's main climate innovation initiative, the Hawley Award from the Worshipful Company of Engineers. They won the Plastics innovation competition: towards zero waste of Innovate UK.As attempts to clean up the oceans are often highlighted as being cost prohibitive and unlikely to succeed based on scaling factors, Ichthion adopts the same strategy as the eponymous fish. It will circumvent both of these issues simultaneously by using existing infrastructures and adding the technology into them. This gives the necessary scale, avoids huge start up costs, and overlaps coverage with the ecologically important coastal zones.",

    "remarks": "As a not-for-profit engineering innovation company, Draper provides unbiased assessments of technology or systems designed or recommended by other organizations — whether custom-designed or commercial-off-the-shelf.Microplastics in the oceans waterways are an ever-growing invisible threat, one that is increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives. This led them to team up with the EPA to combat one of the biggest problems in the world: microplastic contamination. The Mircoplastics-Sensing Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is the first-in-class for microplastic sensing drones. Drapers AUV can detect and analyze invisible microplastics, and enable scientists to understand where they are originating from, where they are most prominent and how to prevent them from contaminating our waters. When the AUV is deployed, it skims the top nine meters of the water where most microplastics are located, scanning for microplastics, testing for specific types, and ultimately relaying GPS coordinates into a heat map.They did this by creating the worlds first real-time microplastic-sensing system in the form of a full-size autonomous underwater drone. The drone will search, find, and analyze this invisible threat to the worlds oceans, coastal regions, and rivers. This will also enable scientists to understand where microplastics originate from and how to prevent them from contaminating our waters.Draper hopes to launch a Plastic Particle Pollution Index posting measurements and trend predictions of microplastic particle concentrations in the worlds oceans, coastal regions and rivers. Draper also plans to make its microplastic sensing technology widely available via open-sourcing so other can contribute to the ppp index.The project is also part of larger long-term strategic design initiative to develop an iconic visual brand language across Drapers different divisions and product categories.",

    "remarks": "A complete end to end solution that optimizes waste collection processes. Nordsense provides a complete end to end solution that optimizes waste collection processes by monitoring container levels, applying advanced data analytics and reducing waste collection trips. It uses cloud-based solutions and artificial intelligence to enable turn-by-turn navigation for waste collection. This eliminates stopping at half empty containers.The solutions it offers are:NS Pod: a small device that can be used with any container or bin. Its novel feature is that it can estimate levels also of plastic bags.NS Platform: It is possible to login to this platform from any device. It provides real time information on bins needing collection. So collection trips and even placement of bins can be optimized so overfull bins are a thing of the past.NS Navigator: This is a mobile application for drivers on collection duties. It lets them know when they have to work, and besides showing the optimal route, it provides directions on which container to stop at. Since information is added in real time, the whole process is dynamic and event driven, and additional full bins can easily be added in the route. It also provides important analytics such as trip duration and cost estimation.The result is that collection trips are minimized,fuel is saved, and trash is collected before containers are overflowing, which leads to illegal dumping. Moreover, congestion on roads by these larger haulers is avoided as well.Nordsense is based in Copenhagen and was started in 2016. Besides working in Copenhagen, they also provide services at San Francisco Public Works. Søren Christensen is the founder and CEO at Nordsense Inc. The company has been covered heavily in Swedish press.",

    "remarks": "Orca Sound Project is a creative platform for sense based experiences and collaborations to raise awareness of our oceans. About 8 million metric tonnes of plastic is dumped in the oceans each year. At the current rate, it is estimated that there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans by 2050. To top it off, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled globally. Orca Sound Project aims to contribute towards reducing the plastic waste present in oceans through creative collaborations and innovations. The organization partners with numerous sound artists and music festival organizers to arrange an event centered around sustainability and ocean conservations. This includes arranging ocean cleanups and ensuring the elimination of single-use plastics.  Orca Sound Project also upcycles the collected wastes into useful products like Orcaboard. Orcaboard is plywood manufactured from 100% mixed waste plastic. Each Orcaboard requires about 30 kg plastic waste sourced directly from the ocean or from the land. The resulting material is sturdy, waterproof and easily washable, making it ideal for temporary use in constructions for events and festivals.In collaboration with Keep Britain Tidy and Shangri-La Glastonbury, they developed the project to build the Glastonbury Music Festival Arena completely from recycled plastic. Waste collection for the project took place between May 11 and May 23, 2019, and an approximate 10 tonnes of plastic was used and processed by Exeter City Council before being recycled into materials to build the stage.The organization also supports global fisheries encouraging them to pick up waste from the oceans in an effort to reduce plastic pollution and combat overfishing.",

    "remarks": "Founded in 2017, 4ocean is a purpose-driven business that aims to clean the worlds ocean and coastlines while working to stop the inflow of plastic by changing consumption habits. They are not a nonprofit, and believe in creating sustainable business solutions to achieve their goals.The 2 founders Alex and Andrew launched the company by creating a handmade bracelet and promising to pull a pound of trash for every bracelet they sold. With the money raised from the sales of these bracelets, they have been able to employ hundreds of people to clean the ocean full-time and pull over 5 million pounds of trash from the ocean and coastlines. Beyond their products, they combat the ocean plastic pollution through technology, cleanups, influence, and education. They are developing and testing several types of skimmers:4ocean Mobile Skimmer recovers marine debris from any waterway using this fuel-efficient vessel. Its articulating arms on the front guide marine debris onto a conveyor belt that leads to a super sack with the capacity to hold up to 220 pounds of debris. Measuring slightly over 22 feet long, the 4Ocean Mobile Skimmer team hopes to be a game-changer for cleaning the worlds oceans. The skimmers require just a few people to run it, and they think they will be able to collect much more plastic in much less time than with other methods.4Ocean Solar Skimmer: this semi-autonomous marine debris collector for river mouths and waterways can be situated on a stationary pontoon platform. It uses water inflow to collect marine debris. Trash is transferred from the waters surface to a 6-yard dumpster by conveyor belt. Full receptacles can be serviced and replaced by a one-man tender barge and transported to a municipal offload site.4Ocean Harbour Skimmer is a shore-powered water pump that collects marine debris in harbours and marinas. The fully automatic floating skimmer can be secured to a dock or pier and connected to shore power to remove debris that accumulates in marinas. Three-hundred gallons of water are pulled into the skimmer every minute and up to 1,200 pounds of marine debris can be collected in the units waste receptacle. One push of a button brings the mesh basket to dock level where debris can be unloaded. The Surface Skimmer runs on a standard 110-volt outlet and is a cost-effective way to keep your harbour or marina free of plastic and other debris.The 4Ocean mobile skimmer is currently been tested locally in Florida and the team is planning to deploy several of them internationally.",

The Bandalong is used in creeks, rivers, canals, or channel waterways to capture floating litter and debris and DOES NOT harm aquatic species or wildlife. StormX is an end-of -pipe netting systems that can be used on pipe out falls, structures, and in channels to capture both floatables and non-floatables. StormX is not used in live streams where aquatic species and wildlife are present.Both products are proven internationally for over 20 years!Plastic recovery capacity: The BANDALONG LITTER TRAP will capture floating litter and debris 24/7 without mechanical assistance. It has unlimited capacity to capture floatables using our unique boom configuration with the trap without restriction of flow or harm to aquatic species or wildlife. Examples: Washington, DC first litter small Bandalong trap captured 6 tons the first year.  A large Bandalong in Mobile, AL 500 cubic yards the first year.NOTE: WITH THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE BANDALONG THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF TRASH FLOWING IN THE WATER THE CAPACITY IS UNLIMITED.STORMX capacity depends on the diameter of the  out flow pipe and the length of the net. All StormX installations need consideration for overflow/bypass options when nets are full of trash and debris.",

    "remarks": "Bantam Materials International in collaboration with Oceancycle has developed a tracking system for products manufactured using certified ocean-bound plastic materials.Oceancycle provides certification for materials at bottle aggregation sites, in at-risk ocean environments, to document them through the supply chain. Bantam manufactures a product line of rPET flakes and pellets using ocean-bound plastic waste. Through the partnership, both companies aim to provide complete traceability of Bantam's rPET products using Oceancycle's certification of the materials. Ocean bound plastic is the term given to any plastic waste found within 50 km distance of ocean coastline. According to experts, an at-risk ocean area is any regional area which lacks waste management, suffers from overpopulation and where plastic pollution poses a serious threat to wildlife. Through the Certified Ocean Bound Plastic collaboration, Bantam aims to allow tracking the rPET materials back to at-risk areas such as SouthEast Asia, the Galapagos, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean. Bantam uses ocean-bound plastic to produce a line of rPET products like:PelletsFlakesBalesPreformWith Certified Ocean Bound Plastic, Bantam and Oceancycle allow tracking of materials used to make these products. Tracking is allowed at all points of the supply chain, mainly:CollectionRecyclingProduction-Ready MaterialAdditionally, the collaboration allows tracking through purchasing notes, delivery notes, scale trucks, dedicated controllers.Through the system, customers, brands, and partners can trace the materials used for the rPET products back to the at-risk ocean areas from where the plastic waste was sourced. Bantam also provides auditing and quality check services of its products ensuring compliance with standards and application requirements. The company sells its products into developed economies like those in the UK, Europe, North America, and Australia. All Bantam products are in compliance with FDA, REACH and EFSA standards.",

    "remarks": "Blue Ocean Gear has developed Smart Buoy technology that allows fishermen to track and locate their fishing gear.Lost fishing gear has global economic and environmental impacts on the ocean, as well as the people and industries that rely on it. Despite fishermens best efforts, fishing gear is lost due to many uncontrollable forces including storms and strong currents. Lost gear continues fishing indiscriminately—both target species and bycatch—without being harvested. This ghost gear depletes the current biomass, reduces future harvests and fishing industry revenue.              Blue Ocean Gears Smart Buoy technology tracks fishing gear at all times, including traps and nets that are far offshore. These buoys alert fishermen of their new location when gear has moved too far, allowing for direct retrieval rather than aimless searching. A wide variety of data from the buoys can be used to help ocean businesses run more efficient and cost-effective operations, both on- and off-shore.Blue Ocean Gears Mission aligns strongly with the UN SDG 14 by addressing marine pollution and working toward sustainable fisheries. They want the ocean to be around for us to use today and far into the future. They have partnered with the Global Ghost Gear Initiative, Hardware Club, Point Blue Conservation Science, and Launch Alaska.  They are currently actively testing in three distinct markets with a steady pipeline through 2021.",

    "remarks": "Bureo was founded in 2013, based in the US and Chile, is focused on finding solutions for the growing issue of plastic pollution in our oceans and initiating social change. Bureos Net+Positiva program works together with fishermen to provide a positive solution for their end of life fishing gear, which Bureo transforms into highly recyclable and durable raw materials.Headquartered in California, Bureo is a certified B-Corporation. It is a participating company in Patagonia's Tin Shed Ventures Fund, an internal fund supporting likeminded start-up companies having a positive impact on the environment.Bureo makes items from recycled fishing nets. Their recycling program in Chile, 'Net Positiva', provides fishing net collection points to keep plastic fishing nets out of our oceans. Preventing harmful materials from entering the ocean, the programs protect wildlife and supporting local fishing communities through financial incentives.Once collected, the nets are washed and prepared for a mechanical recycling process. Within this process, they are shredded and fed through a 'pelletizer', where they are melted and cut into small recycled pellets. These pellets are then injected into steel molds to form their products. Bureo is working with industry leading companies to incorporate their materials called NetPlus into their supply chains. Collaborating with organizations that are willing to go beyond industry standards, Bureo is working closely with these partners to expand and replicate responsible material solutions. Together they can create a net positive impact on our ocean environment.Some of the products they make in collaboration with different companies are:Patagonia: using Netplus for the brim stiffeners in the hatsHumanscale: The first ergonomic task chair made with recycled fishing nets.Smart Ocean Chair: Each chair incorporates almost 2 pounds of recycled fishing net material.Costa Sunglasses: The Untangled Collection has frames constructed from 100% recycled fishing nets and are fit with mineral glass lenses.Jenga Ocean: Jenga® Ocean™ & Bureo. The first board game made from recycled fishing nets. Jenga Ocean is made from over 25 square feet of nets proudly sourced through Bureo's Net Positiva recycling program.Carver Skateboards: 'The Ahi', a performance skateboard made from recycled fishing nets. Futures Fins: The first surf fins made from recycled fishing nets, Futures' Alpha line incorporates Bureo's NetPlus recycled fishing nets with Futures' Compound 6 carbon and air infused technology.They have created a positive impact since 2013, with over 185,000 kg of materials collected to date from 26 participating communities in Chile.",

    "remarks": "Description: Our Concept of Operations is to implement fleets of 100s of FREDs, ranging in size from 50-100 feet, for cleanup of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, coastlines, bays, estuaries, and rivers. FREDs will operate autonomously in the ocean gyres, except when they need human intervention, at which point the Clear Blue Sea staff in our mission control center will take over FRED navigation and perform remote control of FREDs operations and routing.FREDs architecture is comprised of a simple set of subsystems:VESSEL PLATFORM SUBSYSTEM  The supporting elements of FREDs architecture are the hulls and cross beams, which support debris collection and power, and enable FRED to float in marine environments. Hulls can be made from various materials, such as commercial pontoons or fiberglass hulls, or they can be made from raw materials.\tDEBRIS COLLECTION SUBSYSTEM FRED utilizes booms, belts, and bins to capture and store floating marine plastic and debris polluting the environment. The booms, which are floating arms attached to the hull frame, guide floating plastic pollution up onto the conveyor belt, and can be made of plastic, metal, or composite material. The conveyor belt, which is powered by motors receiving electricity from the Power Subsystem, is attached to the hull frame for stability. Marine debris is taken by FREDs conveyor belt to an embedded storage bin, which is sized appropriately for one mission and is able to drain water to lighten the load. POWER SUBSYSTEM FRED is designed to use sustainable energy. To capture the suns energy, FRED utilizes an array of marine-worthy solar panels forming the roof of the vessel. Solar panels can be in the form of flexible, malleable material, or rigid planes that are individually framed. Onboard batteries store electrical energy generated from the solar panels.NAVIGATION SUBSYSTEM FREDs hulls are propelled forward using electrical motors which receive electricity from the solar panel/battery assembly. Propulsion by the motors can be made autonomous or performed via remote control.SENSOR SUBSYSTEM FREDs architecture provides a platform for embedding scientific sensors and instrumentation to be used for collecting data and samples from the environment. Some sensors provide performance information, such as FREDs speed and location, and other sensors capture weather data, such as air and water temperature, wind speed, and current strength. FREDs sensors are powered by solar energy.DATA COMMUNICATIONS SUBSYSTEMWhile FRED is in marine environments, its data communications capability enables commands to be transmitted from ground control to FRED and operational data to be transmitted from FRED to ground control. This enables remote control, navigational routes, and display of FRED operational data. Our 50-foot FRED is designed to deliver the following enhanced capabilities per our system requirements baseline:•\tCollect floating marine plastic and debris ranging in size from 5mm to 5 meters on a 24/7 basis•\tPropel at 2 knots to prevent unannounced infringement on marine life•\tNavigate autonomously based on GPS trajectory commands from mission control staff•\tNavigate under remote control during unsafe conditions (storms, etc.)•\tUtilize only solar power for FRED operations with stored energy available on cloudy days  •\tProvide excess stored energy to governmental and commercial marine Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) for recharging their batteries without having to return to land•\tAlert marine mammals of FRED proximity using appropriate acoustic pingers recommended by marine scientists at Scripps Institute of Oceanography•\tCapture environmental, oceanographic, and marine ecosystem data in real-time for transmittal to designated scientific, governmental, and commercial information systems•\tTransmit sensor and instrumentation data to ground-based mission control systems for Clear Blue Sea staff to monitor, govern, and control fleets of FREDs as requiredPlastic recovery capacity: A scaled-up version of FRED (50 feet long by 30 feet wide), which will be used in Hawaii for our Phase III Pilot Program, will collect an estimated 750 cubic yards of plastic, per FRED, per year. Using the weight of a large plastic bottle, this equates to 56,250 pounds of collected plastic each year, for each FRED in the fleet.",

By rewarding deposit of plastic waste, they can stop leakage of plastic into the environment, and crowdsource the collection and sorting at source of leaked waste.Their mission is that people can pick up plastic waste anywhere in the world, deliver it at a collection point and immediately receive a reward. The use of Blockchain technology ensures full transparency. They are able to track and link every deposit of plastic back to the sponsor who made it possible - thus laying the ground for real Producer Responsibility and digital Deposit Return Schemes (dDRS)Empower is also tracking the collected and registred plastic through the value chain to see where the collected plastic ends up and also making it possible for producers of recycled plastic products to show where the recycled materials is coming from while proving it is done in a responsible and socially good way. The startup is dedicated to be fully transparent in both how plastic waste collection is funded, the social and environmental impact and also where all recycled plastics are coming from and their journey from collection to new product. Empowers platform is a part of the digital infrastructure that the world needs to move from a linear to a circular economy and already in its early years we see the signs of global impact.",

It is secured on both banks or one end is anchored in water as necessary. It is deployed where the stream crosses a road or has road access. The alignment ensures that the plastics and biota lies close to one bank within reach of riverbank based gear. Boats and floating gear is not required to evacuate the collection. Floating plastics, wood, biota etc is captured by this system and mesh opening size is 10 cm x 10 cm, though it can be customized.  Where boat traffic exists the alignment can allow boat movement while  arresting trash and plastics. The alignment is different in tidal streams.  We have different models for river, stream, and smaller drains. All of them are passive systems.Plastic recovery capacity: This has recovered 22000 Tons of trash including 2200 Tons of Plastics in one year in one river. This data is as per the municipal corporation records and has been published in Media. https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-mountain-of-trash-fished-out-of-cooum/article26115438.ece",

Also, there is no issue or risk of collecting marine life as they usually swim away from the robot. The robot can collect different type of waste thanks to its variety of nets: - Reusable micro-waste net (180/250/300 microns mesh)- Reusable milli-waste net (1mm mesh)- Reusable recycled macro-waste net (0,5 to 1cm mesh)The collected waste can be: plastic (e.g. bottles, packaging, cigarette butts), glass (e.g. floating glass bottles filled with air), metallic (e.g. cans and metal cans filled with air, organic waste (e.g. dead fish), natural debris (e.g. driftwood) and floating algae (e.g. duckweed and algae that are not filamentous or stowed at the bottom). In addition, the robot can directly collect in the net any type of floating oil. viscous type hydrocarbons (ex: oil slabs) and light type hydrocarbons (e.g. oils, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil).With its compact size, the remote-controlled Jellyfishbot can easily access hard-to-reach and/or shallow areas where waste is usually accumulated (e.g. between boats, under the ropes, against/under docks or pontoons) in any sheltered areas such ports, marinas, lakes, ponds, etc.Plastic recovery capacity: Our nets are able to collect 80L of plastic each. After that, the user has to empty the net and reuse it to collect 80L of plastic once again. The Jellyfishbot can also clean a 1000m² surface at 1 knot speed. It is extremely easy to change the net by simply using a pole to retrieve it. There is no need to take the robot out of the water.",

    "remarks": "Description: Technical specifications:The Litter Trap is a floating device able to capture plastic litter carried by the river current or wind. CLEAR RIVERS makes the circular approach a crucial element of its strategy, therefore the Litter Traps are almost entirely made from recycled plastic retrieved from the rivers. The device is placed in the opposite direction of the water current making our product both cost-efficient and energy-autonomous. In fact, plastic debris is carried towards the opening of the Litter Trap by the current and the wind and the system does not require energy or human labour to function. Once the litter is trapped inside, it will not be able to “escape” even if the current changes direction, thanks to an innovative semi-closed- door system. Neither the instalment of the Trap nor its operation will cause any harm to the environment. In fact, CLEAR RIVERS designed openings in order to create escape routes for fish and other animals. Birds can also fly through the open part of the Trap. This is a great way to retrieve plastic litter without obstructing the pathways of aquatic organisms.After thorough analyses of the morphological and physical characteristics of rivers and canals, as well as a detailed study of wind and water currents, CLEAR RIVERS designed a modular Litter Trap (made from recycled plastic) that can be transported or shipped everywhere around the world. CLEAR RIVERS is currently developing different types of Litter Trap, where dimensions, capacity and costs change in order to be suitable for rivers and countries worldwide.Potential bottlenecks: - Risk of flooding; in rivers with an extreme fluctuation in water level, the Litter Trap needs an extra secure anchoring system.- Ship traffic; To extend the reach of the Litter Traps we attach floating booms to it to guide the floating debris into the Litter Trap. Intense ship traffic will give limitations to the placement of the booms. A way to overcome this is to have a (small) repetition of Litter Traps, to still retrieve the litter in the second Litter Trap that passed by the first instalment. Measures to avoid collection of biological components:Biological elements can enter the Litter Traps, but can easily be removed on site. The Litter Trap is accessible for emptying and the removal of any obstacles. Plastic recovery capacity: 5m3 per emptying depending on the preferred system (CLEAR RIVERS offers different dimensions for the system; scalable approach). The frequency of emptying depends on the local situation: how fast the Litter Trap fills up, due to weather conditions, pollution quantity, possibilities of local partners to empty, etc.",

Our operational focus is on mid to small size/and mostly rural areas of Indonesia with a tonnage of 30t per day of mixed waste delivered to our facilities. We accept all mixed domestic waste as well as envision to help the local communities with the local industrial waste. Our technology is designed, manufactured and maintained by a fully Indonesian based team. We enable local entrepreneurs and business owners to use our sorted material in their production for a locally based economy to thrive. We plan to run regular local circular economy and design workshops to enable local capacity building.We have strong long term business partners to bring deposit return schemes and other solutions to Indonesia as well.Large investment for infrastructure is the only bottleneck for us.Plastic recovery capacity: Ministry of Waste solution has the highest plastic recovery rate possible as separating plastic out of domestic waste enables us to capture as much plastic as is collected from households, currently estimated at 40-55% of all mixed domestic waste. The total tonnage per facility depends on the input tonnage from the location. If we take minimum 30t/day input at 40% plastic, it would equal 4380t/year from the smallest unit. Some of our locations would have a tonnage input of 200t a day which would equal 14,600t/year of plastic recovered.",

    "remarks": "Net-WorksTM redesigns global supply chains to create sustainable and scalable solutions that reduce marine plastic, increase fish stocks and improve the lives of marginalized coastal communities living in biodiversity hotspots of developing countries.On the current trajectory of plastic pollution and over fishing there will be one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of fish in the ocean by 2025. The people most affected are those in marginalized rural communities within biodiversity hotspots of the developing world, especially in Southeast Asia which contributes for over 60% of the worlds marine debris, is the center of marine biodiversity, contains 55% of the global population of artisanal reef fishers and suffers the highest level of fishing pressure.Net-Works provides a simple, scalable and holistic model to deliver less plastic, more fish and improve the lives of marginalized coastal communities across Southeast Asia by applying the principles of fair trade and inclusive business. They created efficient community-based supply chains for raw materials (plastics and seaweed carrageenan) that are available in abundance. They link these raw materials to conservation actions that reduce plastic pollution and restore coastal ecosystems. Increasing incomes from seaweed reduces dependence on fishing & enables communities to set aside larger No-Take zones (NTZs). They sell these raw materials into global supply chains, giving international brands opportunities to source premium products with positive social and environmental stories, giving fishing communities a more transparent and dependable price, and providing sustainable funding sources for local conservation and development actions. To manage local supply chains, they set up community banks, bringing communities together in informal cooperatives and providing much-needed access to financial services, using the globally recognized and proven Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model. These community banks are the social glue at the heart of Net-Works, enabling members to invest in their sustainable livelihoods, building a Net-Works conservation constituency. So far they have:Collected >195 metric tonnes of nets (increasing daily) which have been recycled into high quality nylon yarn and sold to Interface, Inc. to make high design carpet tiles.Conducted successful scientific trials of ecological seaweed farming in the Philippines. They have prototyped the first bigger community-based MPA needed to replenish fish stocks, covering 627ha, with 202ha in a NTZ (up from the average12ha) in the Philippines. They are currently finalizing ordinances for a further three communities with NTZs over 200ha in size.Built the best-practice standards and toolsImproved the marine environment for 64,000 people.Received awards and recognition in the media, including the US Secretary of States Award for Corporate Excellence, MRW National Recycling Awards Business Partnership of the year (2017), Guardian Sustainable Business award for collaboration (2015) among others.",

Their mission is to create meaningful employment and positive local impact in these communities. Community sources - Global Impact They work with local collection partners around the world, creating meaningful employment and cleaner waterways. The Oceanworks team is a seasoned group of design and engineering professionals. They have deep manufacturing partnerships in Asia and have been at the forefront of sustainable design efforts before it was cool. They optimize design and manufacturing for efficiency and quality so that ocean plastic will be used most effectively. They can also help to source and manage suppliers. Oceanworks sourced plastic is documented from collection source to retail shelf. They follow the material and its collection source and then monitor the chain of custody all the way through to the final product. This gives brands and factories assurances that the ocean plastic was ethically collected for a living wage. They are working with leading experts in ocean debris, technical expertise on polymers, and waste management. Oceanworks was born out of Norton Point, an eyewear company that launched a line of ocean plastic sunglasses in 2016. Funded on Kickstarter in just 6 days, the project raised awareness of ocean plastic worldwide and opened our eyes to the many disparate elements that need to be woven together to develop a product that truly makes a difference. Ultimately, this realization led us to found Oceanworks.",

    "remarks": "Germany-based One Earth-One Ocean is a nonprofit organization working towards cleaning up oceans globally to free them from marine litter and oil and chemical pollution.One Earth-One Ocean (OEOO) aims to reduce the extent of ocean pollution through the concept and technology of the 'Marine Litter Cleanup'.The Marine Litter Cleanup project comprises of two collection vessels which can be used in inland waters or oceans to collect plastic waste from rivers. The project aims to collect, sort and process the waste to create recycled plastic bales along with recovering fuel and energy. So far, the project has been deployed in two stages:SeeHamster: the first generation collectors launched in 2012 have been updated to the 5th generation in 2019. These are small catamarans about four metres long and two metres wide and a fold-down net or fishing gear with which plastic garbage from inland waters is collected. The SeeHamsters are in use in Cambodia, Germany and Asia. SeeKuh: launched in Lubek in 2016, the collector can gather the waste from a depth of 4 metres. The ship, also based on the catamaran shape, has a size of 12 x 10 meters and will clean bays, estuaries and coastal sections. It is also equipped with a water analyzer which can test water samples to identify the type of waste or other sources of pollution. The SeeKuh vessels are the first to be licensed by DNV/GL worldwide. OEOO aims to make the SeeKuh vessels completely reliant on renewable energy sources like solar or wind in the future. Additionally, OEOO has launched the SeeElefant, which treats, sorts and processes the waste collected by the vessels using a plant technology that has been integrated into the ship. The SeeElefant can produce plastic bales as well as recover energy and fuel from the waste. The plastic waste is crushed and cleaned and plastics like PVC and PET are sorted out. The remaining mixture is melted and evaporated to separate chlorine and sulfur. The remaining gas is then condensed to obtain fuel. Around 30% of the fuel is consumed by the vessels and the rest can be sold to other ships and vessels. Waste processing is done in partnership with BIOFABRIK, using their WASTX Plastic technology. OEOO has also built the International Marine Litter Database, an extensive database comprising of scientific studies and findings on marine litter from around the world. One Earth-One Ocean has received a number of awards for their work, including 2017 European Inventor Award and the Federal Award for Ecodesign in 2019. The organization is supported by brands like Bruckner Group, Novus, Greenland Seafood and Denner among others.",

With new transponder technology, either integrated with the boat's sonar or as a stand-alone system, PingMe makes it easy to find and identify lost gear underwater.Ghost fishing and lost gear (mostly gill-nets) from the fisheries represent a major environmental problem. For the fisheries, this is also linked to reputation. Lost gear means financial loss and reduced efficiency for the fisherman. Lost gear is also a danger to those traveling by sea. Tagging gear for easier detection is likely to be regulated in the future.PingMe is patented and consists of three units:PingMe transponder: A smart, small device attached to gear/objects you want identified and located underwaterPingMe software: A software module integrated in the boat's existing sonar system or as a stand-alone system.  The software allows communication with the transponder to determine location and ID.PingMe Service in the cloud: A management tool for the authorities. Information of lost, detected and retrieved gear is reported to the cloud, some of it automatically. This enables the authorities to keep better control of litter in the ocean, which might come in conflict with other boats or fisheries.Ocean Space Acoustics (OSAC) is an innovative company that contributes to a sustainable fishery and a cleaner ocean through its solutions. Basic technology is being developed in collaboration with SINTEF, Norway's largest research institute.",

    "remarks": "Pinovo offers an innovative vacuum blasting technology to reduce the amount of microplastics that end up in Norwegian oceans when old paint is removed from industrial surfaces. Pinovos technology and surface maintenance tools drastically reduce waste and emissions and protect the marine ecosystem and human food chain.   While paints are essential for protecting offshore steel structures from corrosion, due to the salt content in oceans, the removal of old paint from the steel surfaces leads to ocean pollution. Currently, the 12-billion-dollar sandblasting industry produces heavy metals, toxic dust, and microplastics too.Pinovo has developed an ATEX-certified closed loop grip basting technology, which is also known as vacuum blasting or dust-free blasting. This technology helps customers save money, improve HSE, and also protect the environment without any compromise being made on the quality of the work. Some of its products are:PiBlast: An automated, fully pneumatic, closed-loop vacuum blasting tool intended for dust-free abrasive blasting of straight pipes.PiCo Pipe: A hand-held closed-loop vacuum blasting tool intended for dust-free abrasive blasting of pipes.PiHab: A flexible, transparent, abrasive blasting enclosure to be used with the Pinovo vacuum blasting units PiSys.PiWalk: A walk-behind tool primarily intended for dust-free vacuum blasting of medium-sized flat or walkable inclined surfaces.PiConnect: A versatile, hand-held closed-loop vacuum blasting tool primarily intended for spot and sweep blasting. Due to the click-on adapter technology, a variety of surface geometries can be blast cleaned easily.PiPoint: A hand-held closed-loop vacuum blasting tool primarily intended for small spots with difficult access.PiSys: A fully pneumatic ATEX certified closed-loop vacuum blasting and recycling unit, designed for dust-free abrasive blastingAll Pinovo products are safe to use, and make activities like blasting, sheeting, cleaning, and painting efficient. Other work disciplines or surrounding equipment are not affected by them. Some other advantages are their low noise emissions, less dust and grit production, low vibration, ergonomic design, light weight, and a robust waste management system.    Pinovo supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution by 2025, and achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes by 2020.Some companies that Pinovo works with are Shell, Equinor, EDF, AkerBP, Chevron, Repsol Sinopec, and the Norwegian Armed Forces.Their technology is an ideal solution for companies looking for offshore industrial painting and cleaning services. Pinovos distributors are located in France, Benelux, USA, Canada, and Trinidad.",

    "remarks": "Description: How it WorksIn Plastic Bank recycling ecosystems, collectors collect ocean-bound plastic (plastic collected within 30 miles of the ocean or waterway leading to an ocean) and deposit their recyclables at a local Plastic Bank branch or certified partner location. The plastic is sorted by type and colour, then weighed. The corresponding value is deposited into their digital account. Plastic Bank members receive a bonus in addition to the market value for their plastic. This ensures Plastic Bank members receive a stable and fair earned income. They can store and redeem the value at any time at a Plastic Bank branch or certified partner location.When a collector registers with Plastic Bank they receive a blockchain-secured digital wallet, virtual identity information, trust score and credit score. Through the digital platform, collectors and their families can become eligible for health insurance and school tuition. Our co-op community model empowers co-op members to gain co-op voting rights, equal profit sharing and shared ownership of their local programs.A branchs ongoing participation with Plastic Bank requires that they comply with Plastic Banks code of conduct for transparent ethical sourcing and maintain the required trust scores and standing.Types of Plastic Collected- Mixed Plastic- HDPE- PET- PP- PS- LDPE- PVC- ABS- Caps- Custom PlasticsBuilt for TrustPlastic Banks platform is designed for unlimited scale while maintaining speed, transparency and security through the use of IBMs enterprise-level technology stack. The technology stack utilizes blockchain and HyperLedger Fabric on private LinuxOne servers and the IBM Cloud.Utilizing the power of blockchain, Plastic Bank has created a tokenized reward system. Plastic Bank digital tokens act as loyalty points or credits, earned by recycling, with a guaranteed liquidation value of 0.01 USD per token. This system securely provides savings, cashless spending, and instant value distribution, with guaranteed delivery of the value promised to the members.Plastic Bank digital rewards can only be created by Plastic Bank. Digital rewards are not available through a public exchange. The creation of a token is matched with funds in a bank account controlled by Plastic Bank. Bonus rewards are instantly unlocked to eligible members at the time of exchange per kilogram of eligible material. In most programs, branches receive a distribution/reporting bonus upon verified re-sale of the equivalent amount of materials they rewarded to their collectors. Creating end-to-end trust and audibility.Impact MetricsSince the starting operations in Haiti in 2016, Plastic Bank has achieved the following impact:- 13,396,103 kg of plastic prevented from entering the ocean - thats the equivalent of 669,805,150 plastic bottles- 20,692 total collectors engaged- 9374 women collectors- 320 collection branches - Over 100,000 transactions- Equivalent of over $600,000 in bonus rewards distributed- Recognized for achieving 14 of 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals- Over 75 corporate partners - 10 of which have incorporated Social Plastic® into their products and packagingPlastic recovery capacity: Plastic Bank is increasing momentum and is now collecting approximately 1 million kilograms of plastic per month across our global operations. 1041483 kg collected in June 2020, and 1,200,202 kg collected in July 2020.

Plastic Vortex aims to reduce such upstream pollution using a simple system that captures the waste floating down rivers.The Plastic Vortex system consists of a floating platform connected with floating arms that make a V-shape. The system faces the downstream flow of a river. All floating waste is captured by the arms and directed towards the platform at the centre.The waste is transferred to a tub by a conveyor belt, which is rotated by turbines that run on the river currents and not on electricity or fuel. The tub is carried to the shore using a hand-operated pulley.The floating devices and arms are made of waste materials like plastic bottles.The Plastic Vortex team visits the system, which is installed on the Garrone river, several times during the week depending on the weather conditions. They recover an average of thirty plastic bottles at each visit. The system which has so far collected 112 kilograms of floating waste including 1,083 plastic bottles. The inventor is seeking €35,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to produce and deploy its second system in 2020. It is doing research to make the system more reliable and aims to deploy it on other rivers in the Occitanie region and eventually in all of France.Its partners include Orange Foundation, Dassault Systems, FAB14+, and Artilect.",

In Uruguay, a country of 3.4 million people, only 35% of plastic waste is collected for recycling.Plasticoin aims to incentivize consumers to deposit their plastic waste in return for virtual currency. The project is undergoing pilot tests at a seaside resort in Piriapolis city on the countrys Atlantic Ocean coast:Consumers can register online and deposit plastic waste from their household or collected from the beach at one of the three designated collection centers. They receive Plasticoin currency on their phone based on the weight and type of waste discarded. The minimum waste is one kg, for which they receive Plasticoins. To promote clean coastal zones, plastic waste and microplastic removed from beaches and oceans results in a higher Plasticoin payment.The customers can use the currency to get discounts at partnered shops and restaurants. These include yoga centers, surfboard shops, and shops selling bags, toothbrushes, pizza, haircuts, and coffee, among other products.Plasticoins launched in January 2020 with a grant of $5000 from the Uruguan governments National Development Agency. The project received more than a thousand users within three weeks, against a target of 100 users in a month.The project is looking for companies that can provide discounts on their products to Plasticoin users. It is also looking for companies to advertise on the Plasticoin platform. Based on the number of Plasticoins received by the company, it can claim tax benefits under a 2019 law passed in the country.",

Both these plastics can be used by themselves or in a blend for producing new items. Regular users of their material can get a certificate as “Certified Recyclates User of Discarded Fishing Net and Trawl” to show as CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) achievements. They remind their clients that using their green material saves precious fossil fuels, reduces plastic pollution on land and oceans, and reduces CO2 emissions.Plastix has been co-funded by the European Union within the CIP Eco-Innovation initiative of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) through the Retrawl project. Plastix is located in Lemvig, Denmark and operates in Scandinavia, the Baltic Region, most of Europe and South Africa.Their technology transforms an extensive disposal/deposit problem – discarded fishing nets and other post-use plastic waste fractions –  into valuable recycled HDPE and PP plastics raw materials.Awareness of environmental impacts, geopolitics and a focus on increasing efficiency in the collecting of waste streams has created incentives for the fishing industry to stop dumping used fishing gear into the ocean, thus moving the issue to on-shore handling of nets and other types of gear.Their creativity for solutions derives from the imagination, designs, innovations, strategies and collective implementation methodologies that meet the diverse needs of their clients and partners. Through the use of technology, they provide treatment methods that have shown the ability to effectively recycle plastics and metals from net and trawl without downgrading the quality and thereby losing valuable resources. With their recycling technology the used maritime materials can be recycled 100% in a closed loop.",

Working in association with national and international partners, they have conducted research and implemented solutions.Among their research is a project that utilizes satellites to detect ocean plastics. The Sentinel-2 satellites will allow PML scientists to assess oceanic changes and assist in managing impacts in human-affected inland water and marine environments. Using satellite imagery, patches of floating plastics can be detected and mapped. This technology is 86% accurate at distinguishing plastics from naturally occurring floating materials.The research team continues to improve their methods to increase accuracy in large river systems and turbid coastal waters. The results of their research can help inform the development of improved international agreements to effectively combat the marine plastics problem.PML was the first organization to identify that microplastics are damaging to zooplankton and was instrumental in the scientific reasoning behind the UK legislation that banned microplastic beads. PML continues its outreach activities globally to increase public awareness of the global plastic issue and to urge policymakers and manufacturers to act.",

    "remarks": "Description: The world is struggling to answer the question: How do we stop ocean plastic leakage permanently, and do so as quickly and efficiently as possible? Permanent reduction results from solving the complex root causes behind mismanaged waste, deeply tied to the interwoven economic, regulatory, technical, social and behavioural norms of a region. Solutions need to be found that are culturally appropriate, inclusive, economically sustainable, technically rigorous, and built on a foundation of transparent, reliable governance, all of which takes time to develop. Yet, we are in a plastic crisis and need to move and scale quickly without neglecting the fundamental building blocks required for systemic change.  To do this, first, we must focus our time and resources where it matters most - on the locations with the highest pollution levels coupled with strong government and local commitment. We then need to unearth local collective wisdom and leadership, to quickly get to what will work and co-develop a plan forward that everyone can stand behind to develop economically sustainable, circular, zero leakage waste systems. We also need to ensure sufficient revenue is available to cover the costs of each waste system, especially in Indonesia where waste funding is generally insufficient.Project STOP partners with cities and local government to build resilient and economically sustainable waste systems that eliminate leakage of plastics into the environment and ocean.  Nearly 80% of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems comes from land sources. About 50% of this comes from emerging countries like Indonesia, China, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. Project STOP aims to assist countries like Indonesia who have pledged to reduce the country ocean levels by 70% by 2025. This is to be done by helping establish an effective waste management system in the country.  Launched in 2017, Project STOP is an initiative co-founded by Borealis and SYSTEMIQ that designs, implements, and scales circular economy solutions to prevent plastic pollution in Southeast Asia. Project STOP supports cities with experienced waste management, plastic recycling, organic waste management, community engagement, behavior change and program governance experts. The team works in a simple system: •\tScoping: Assessing cities for ocean pollution and government involvement. •\tPreparation & Design: Stakeholder agreements to build an effective waste management system. •\tImplementation: Equip the community to operate the waste management system economically. •\tScale Up: Expanding to new regions to establish change.  Working with companies, local governments and community groups, Project STOP also aims o create new jobs in waste management and reduce the harmful impact of mismanaged waste on public health, tourism and fisheries. Project STOPs long-term ambition is to establish new solutions and models that can be rapidly scaled-up across the whole plastics chain, from the uses of plastic to waste collection and recycling, in areas where there is need to improve the management of plastic waste. Project STOP currently works in the coastal cities of  Muncar (Population: 130,000 inhabitants) in East Java, Lekok and Ngulign in Pasuruan (Population: 130,000 inhabitants) in East Java, and Jembrana (Population: 160,000 inhabitants) in northwest Bali.  Along with co-founders SYSTEMIQ and Borealis, Project Stops strategic partners include the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nova Chemicals, Nestlé, Alliance to End Plastic Waste and Borouge.Plastic recovery capacity: We collect all the plastic waste generated. We sort it and based on our capture rate (40-70% - depending on facility) and our available markets we sell the plastic to aggregators. In Indonesia, a city of 100k people produce annually ~1,500 tons of plastics. Our aim is to achieve >90% collection coverage within 2 years.",

    "remarks": "ReCleanSea is a non-profit organisation that is developing a unique system designed to clean up, on an industrial level, large polluted regions where floating plastic trash has accumulated with currents, winds or waves in rivers, estuaries or coastal areas. Leveraging 15+ years of experience collecting trash and heavy oil at sea and in freshwaters with small to mid-size collectors, they are building a massive apparatus. They leverage their founders 20-year experience in designing, building and operating industrial systems to tow extra-wide underwater imaging tools, as well as oil and plastic trash collectors, like the 150 small ones that the French Navy uses to protect the French coasts from oil spills.The trash collectors can be anchored in rivers or estuaries, or towed by one or two fishing or work boats in any area, after a simple half-day training session. As such, they can benefit any local community all over the world.Their proof of concept consists in building an extra-wide collector, to be towed by an existing ship, itself modified to accommodate an onboard plastic treatment unit for sorting the trash and possibly testing some recycling features. Their XXL collector is scalable, thanks to parts that are 100 m wide each, which allows it to reach 500 m in width and 700 m in length.Towed by the ship in various sea conditions during their test campaign, the extra-wide collector will sweep a large area polluted with ocean plastics. Plastic debris will accumulate in the filtering net at the tip of the collector, which is pulled back to the ship when full. Once onboard, the filtering net will be emptied onto the ship, and the plastic will be sorted and processed for recycling, while the filtering net will return to sea for another sweep.The collectors have never caught any fish in 15 years of operation. When they are towed, its at the very slow speed of 2 knots, which gives fish plenty of time to feel the draft and move away, especially as the immersed skirts of the collector are not deep. When the collectors are anchored in a river, they also let any marine life escape the current towards the filtering net.Founding partners have contributed to a starting budget to promote the project and look for investors. They are in talks with different public and private entities, internationally, to wrap their budget.They estimate the cost of the extra-wide collector alone at €800K. Adding the cost of research and studies, of modifying the ship to accommodate a treatment unit and of course the cost of the test campaign at sea, they have budgeted €5M for the proof of concept.As for any trash collection and recycling process, they believe in a combination of two main factors to make this a sustainable business model:There is a specific market for recycled ocean plastic as a raw material, with higher value than land plastic.Considering the actual cost of plastic pollution, loss of revenues from fisheries and tourism, and serious damages to the environment, they believe that ocean plastic recovery, even subsidised, is a matter of survival for natural ecosystems and mankind.They aim to build the collector in 2019 and have the test campaign at sea in 2019-2020.They are looking for partners and investors to support the first series of tests of the proof of concept and to support the association.

    "remarks": "Renew Oceans is a non-profit organization working to reduce ocean plastic pollution where it begins—in populous, river-adjacent communities in the developing world. Their vision is to create highly scalable, circular economies for plastics in river communities which are known to be the biggest contributors of ocean plastic pollution—starting with the Ganges basin. The Renew Oceans strategy leverages science, technology, and human capital to achieve their ambitious goals. Their inaugural project, Renew Ganga, is the centerpiece of their efforts to divert ocean-bound plastics in India, empowering local women and others in Varanasi to help protect rivers and oceans from plastic pollution.Renew Oceans aims to solve the problem of plastic pollution by using an integrated approach toward collection planning, conversion technology, and community engagement.Renew Oceans is focused on the collection of both hard and soft plastics through both river- and land-based methods, leveraging innovative technologies including ReFences and Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs). They have implemented conversion of traditionally low value film and flexible plastics via RenewOne into renewable fuel to address the lack of end markets for soft plastics. Lastly, their community engagement campaigns foster changes in longstanding habits and perceptions. Renew Oceans works with students and community leaders, and their empowerment of and financial incentives for women waste pickers, builds momentum and drives adoption of new behaviors.Renew Oceans' initiatives are sponsored by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste with support from Happy Family Organics. In their first year, over 100,000 pounds of waste was diverted from the Assi River tributary, and more than 1,000 community members were engaged. In 2020, they aim to double that, diverting over 200,000 pounds of waste and engaging 10,000 members of the community in their work.Governments, NGOs, waste collection & disposal companies, and bioenergy companies are potential clients.",

The Seabin unit is installed in a strategic upstream location where marine litter converges naturally. Generally Ports, Marinas and City foreshores are the main installation points. Each unit filters 600,000 litres of water per day for micro plastics, oil, surface pollutants and general plastics including plastic fibers. Currently the global average capture is 3.9Kgs per day or 1.4 tons of marine litter per year. The cost to filter 600,000 litres of water is AUD$3.31 per day. The units are also solar compatible.The next Seabin 6.0 is currently in production and will be incorporating under water sensors to monitor electrical conductivity, dissolvable oxygen and water temp as baseline data. The sensor technology is also designed as an appendage to be swapped out for other more relevant sensors to that region. Seabin are now offering services for citys and governments which not only include the daily empties and quarterly maintenance, but also the weekly data sets for the Pollution Index® For Prevention:Seabin Foundation use education and community initiatives combined with the Pollution Index® data monitoring program.The Pollution Index® (PI) program is operational in 19 countries with a network of 71 volunteers uploading data sets weekly of what the Seabin smart tech is capturing.Currently a Pollution Index® data app is being developed and will be operational by December 2020.Plastic recovery capacity: Daily: 3.9 kgs per unitPer Year – 1.4 tons per unit Global fleet is 860 units- daily capture is 3.6 tons per day and 500 million litres of water filtered per day Each unit has the capacity to catch:90,000 plastic bags / year35,700 coffee cups / year16,500 plastic water bottle s/ year166,500 plastic utensils",

Working together with fishermen in the collection of all sorts of plastic polluting the bottom of our oceans, Seaqual then transform PET into high quality yarn that goes straight into fabrics and clothing. Dealing with the inconsistency of the debris removed by the fishermen that results from exposure to sun, salt and water, required many months of investment in R&D. They are now able to create a 100% recycled polyester filament of the highest quality.Collecting debris directly from the sea, not the beaches or the coast make this project absolutely unique in its proposal. For collecting the plastic waste, more than 400 boats and 1500 Fishermen from the Spanish Mediterranean coast are involved in the project. Garbage caught in the fishermens nets is collected every day and taken to different ports. The waste is collected weekly, they are classified and categorized so that each material (aluminum, glass, pet plastic,) goes to its unique recycling chain. The PET Plastic is accumulated for conversion into flakes and later into polymer. The polymer can be used to make fabrics and then garments and thus completing the cycle.",

The Bandalong is used in creeks, rivers, canals, or channel waterways to capture floating litter and debris and DOES NOT harm aquatic species or wildlife. StormX is an end-of -pipe netting systems that can be used on pipe out falls, structures, and in channels to capture both floatables and non-floatables. StormX is not used in live streams where aquatic species and wildlife are present.Both products are proven internationally for over 20 years!Plastic recovery capacity: The BANDALONG LITTER TRAP will capture floating litter and debris 24/7 without mechanical assistance. It has unlimited capacity to capture floatables using our unique boom configuration with the trap without restriction of flow or harm to aquatic species or wildlife. Examples: Washington, DC first litter small Bandalong trap captured 6 tons the first year.  A large Bandalong in Mobile, AL 500 cubic yards the first year.NOTE: WITH THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE BANDALONG THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF TRASH FLOWING IN THE WATER THE CAPACITY IS UNLIMITED.STORMX capacity depends on the diameter of the  out flow pipe and the length of the net. All StormX installations need consideration for overflow/bypass options when nets are full of trash and debris.",

    "remarks": "Description: Since the beginning of the development of our technology, we have been in search of a simple solution.  To offer a permanent solution that can be scalable in so many different conditions, including where resources are limited simplicity represents high value. That is why we worked to keep the Blue Barriers simple to build, to be installed and to maintain. The structure is made by two parts: floating modules (made of recycled and recyclable polyethylene) and a supporting internal steel structure that makes the barriers rigid and able to resist to challenging river conditions thanks to three steel cable that cross the barriers. We consider several anchorage and mooring system options to adapt at the specific river; however, in case of rivers of a width below 50m we consider an anchorage above the river level, via steel cables. This allows avoiding creating any obstacle in the river flow. In wider rivers, we will choose anchorage in the river bad (deadweights or piles). Images that describes the Blue Barriers structure will be emailed to the address below. The area where the material will be collected will be along the riverbank in order to facilitate the removal of the material also in case of balky debris like logs. The collection area will be equipped by a steel grid that will screen the material, keep an active water flow that will drive the material toward the collection point and when specifically sized will allow the passage of biological components like fish eggs and other water organisms that might float.The system will be equipped with an automatic and manual opening system that will allow disengaging the barriers in case of emergency. The manual system provides a backup of the automatic one and the option of opening the barriers in case of forecasted exceptional floodings.The structure does not require energy to function ones installed. The only energy required will be for the collection of the debris with a mechanical arm with a crab or conveyor belt.The Blue Barriers have been developed with a modular design to fit any size of river, canal or water stream and for minimizing the cost of production, transportation and maintenance.Scientific studies report that a relevant portion of the plastic transported by the rivers accumulated below the water level in the first 50cm of the water column. That is why we designed the barriers in order to sink from 70 to 90 cm.Possible challenges will be the case of the transportation of abundant balky debris (logs, branches etc.). The Barriers structure will be sized to resist to such balky debris and the disengagement systems will be activated in case of exceptional quantities of wood transported.The simplicity of the structure, also, allows us to produce locally the barriers in the country where they will be installed, creating jobs locally and minimizing the environmental footprint of transportation.Plastic recovery capacity: The quantity of plastic collected will depend on the rivers where we will install our solution. Considering the estimate of plastic transported by the 20 most polluted rivers in the world (Lebreton et al, 2017), if we would install our barriers we would collect 1.19Mton of plastic per year.",

    "remarks": "The founders of The Great Bubble Barrier believe plastic waste can be caught before it reaches the oceans.Too much of the waste that our society produces ends up in the water, where it damages marine and human life. Sea turtles and fish get caught up in plastic, ships are obstructed in their paths, and micro plastics form a health hazard for the smallest to the largest organisms. Plastic soup is recognized as an international problem more and more, by both the public, municipalities, government and the European Union. The current solutions that stop waste in the rivers have two major drawbacks unfortunately; they block ship traffic and/or hinder fish movement.The Great Bubble Barrier team searched for an elegant solution that blocks waste in the river, but also allows the passage of fish and ships. They arrived at a very simple idea: a barrier of bubbles.The Great Bubble Barrier offers a solution for different problem-owners: it can help governments meet changing regulation on waste management in waterways, but also help cities fight plastic problems in their waters and help waterboards to save on their cleanups after high water. The three co-founders of the Great Bubble Barrier, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, all have a big passion for sailing and nature. This is what inspired them to look for a fitting solution to the plastic soup, both fish & ship friendly.They have successfully run pilots in partnership with Deltares, Rijkswaterstaat & BAM / VandenHerik,  and are supported by sustainable & offshore organizations like Sustainable Young 100, Our Oceans Challenge, By The Ocean We Unite and the Plastic Soup Foundation. The Bubble Barrier intercepts 1 mm plastics in rivers and canals, and the team will further explore the possibilities and impact of our Bubble Barrier on microplastics coorperating with a research consortium formed by PWN (a drinking water company), KWR (research institut) and Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier (HHNK - water management board). This consortium is starting a study to prevent microplastics from purified wastewater from flowing into surface water. With this, the consortium is taking a step towards clarifying the nature of the cause and reducing the occurrence of microplastics in surface water as they can pose a threat to people and the environment.The new Bubble Barrier installed in Wervershoof will give an insight into the physical effect of the Bubble Barrier on microplastics with a size of 0.5 mm to 0.02 mm.As 8 of the 10 most polluted rivers in the world, are located in Asia, the team want to bring The Great Bubble Barrier there as soon as possible and are hoping to start there in a couple of years from now. The first steps, and contacts have been made.",

    "remarks": "Osprey Initiative, LLC is an environmental contractor providing tailored solutions to the global challenge of litter in our waters. Their mission is to bridge the gap between intent and action in the sustainability world by bringing and implementing realistic solutions to clients, partners and communities.Osprey is the owner of the Litter Gitter, a patented small stream litter collection device used to intercept floating litter from stormwater runoff. Intial tests indicate an 80+% success rate in preventing the downstream loss of floating litter. Osprey handles all aspects of installing and maintaining the Litter Gitter. Litter is separated from vegetative debris and recyclables are separated from the regular trash.As litter or debris floats down the waterway, it encounters the floating boom system, which is anchored in the embankment and attached to the Litter Gitter device. As litter hits these booms, the litter flows naturally into the trap where it waits until it is removed by the Osprey field crews for sorting, recycling, and data collection. The data from the captured litter provides a litter profile for each watershed that can be used to inform, develop, and implement source-targeted solutions. Data collection can be tailored to the specific requirements for a particular project, study, or grant. Quantities are recorded and results are reported on a quarterly basis for inclusion in MS4 reporting if needed.Osprey Initiative heavily emphasizes an approach that is low-tech, high-touch, and environmentally-friendly. They utilize kayaks, rubber waders, shallow draft mud boats, and a hands-on team, to remove harmful litter from the environment without negatively impacting the natural landscape and habitats. Osprey's goal is to manufacture the Litter Gitters using the aluminum collected by their river cleanup efforts. Another specialty service includes tactical cleanups of small and shallow waterways. Their methods range from walking in hip boots to canoes/kayaks to shallow draft mudboats to skiffs. Their cleanups are focused on causing a minimal impact to the natural environment and simple methods, even if they require some additional labor. They also provide safety and logistical support to community-based clean-ups.The company recently launched a product line that includes the Trash Stash, a wired cube or tower that securely stores litter you may find along your route. This product is designed to fit anywhere; secure them in the back of a truck bed, attached to a bike, or in a boat (motorized or not). They closed with a secured bungee cord, so it's always easy to throw litter right in, but secure enough to keep it there until it's time to empty. With every purchase of an Osprey product, 10% of the gross revenue goes right back into funding litter clean-ups.Whether they are deploying a Litter Gitter or conducting a systematic cleanup of a particular watershed, Osprey wants to leave an impact of environmental positivity and displays that passion in all facets of their company.  This solution is unique in that it aims to capture litter further upstream and closer to source points and can be affordably scaled to deploy several devices at key intercept locations on shallow waters and unique river bends. If there is a river or shallow body of water near you flooded with litter, contact the Osprey team about installing and managing a Litter Gitter! Currently cleaning up several rivers across the Southeast United States, this team continues to grow with new partnerships. As of April 2020, Osprey Initiative has 30 Litter Gitters in 11 watersheds, with more to come in the Summer of 2020. Learn more about where the Litter Gitter is cleaning by viewing the linked newsletters and website.",

    "remarks": "The Litterboom Project is an initiative by Parley, that works on a solution to stop the flow of marine plastic waste.Approximately  90 percent of the plastic that causes marine pollution comes from river systems. Therefore the project aims to work on the preventive solutions by targeting the river systems instead of dealing with only oceans.The project stops the flow of plastic in the river systems and other local water sources using large, sealed, and robust pipes known as Litterbooms. The pipes are anchored across the river and it acts as a catchment for all surface-level plastics, which mostly consist of HDPE and PET. Each site consists of two to three Litterbooms. Keeping the storm and heavy rain in mind, the pipes are designed in a manner that under strain it only breaks from one side, preventing the loss of entire Litterboom when rivers rise. The preventive measure is set up strategically in a way that the team can collect most of the waste, sort, and send the plastic off for recycling. The project has successfully prevented 250 000 kgs of plastic from reaching the ocean in the past 2 years. This is done by engaging people from the local community. It has partnered with Parley, Tufbag, Wildlands, Astore Keymak, Fine Metals, and Cape Bulk Bags.The project is currently operating in five River systems around Durban, as well as 2 major river systems in Cape Town and aims to develop sustainable models that can be used throughout South Africa as well as Globally in the future.It benefits the communities, industries, government, and environment.",

    "remarks": "Sea Cleaners is an association that wants to tackle marine plastic pollution. They aim to remove the plastic out of water, in high density areas (coasts, estuaries) before it breaks down into microplastic, and the chemicals leach out, harming the marine life and people. They also want to decrease the large amounts of plastic waste in the oceans.The boat that will be used is called Manta, as it draws its inspiration from the mantis, and its large mouth. The Manta is meant for operations in open sea. It will be a floating factory that collects, sorts, compacts and stores plastic waste. Mantas will have three collecting treadmills between the hulls of the ship to scoop up big quantities of plastics. By compacting the waste, the Manta will be able to accommodate large quantities of waste and is estimated to hold 250 tons of waste. This will then be carried back to land and forwarded to relevant recycling centers. Besides cleaning the oceans, this project aims to conduct scientific observation, and involve itself in prevention of pollution, in education and achieving a circular economy.The MANTA is based on the most advanced technologies in terms of clean energy, design, naval architecture, waste collection and treatment at sea. However, this is still work in progress, and they want more partners who will get involved and help in improving the design of the boat. The company is also looking for technical and financial partners to take the project forward. Feasibility studies have been carried out for eighteen months and a model ship is nearly ready.Sea Cleaners was founded in 2016 by Yvan Bourgnon, a French Swiss explorer, and is based in France. Sea Cleaners work has already won it approval from The Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation who are interested in environment protection.",

One of best reasons is its social role with local fishermen. Indeed, we recommand to use the local fishermen knowledge fo using ours trawls nets. Fishermen are always happy to help and save their marine environment. Second reason, these tools are very easy and very quickly to implement. For example, we just need one boat (Like a zodiac with 50 hp) and 2 persons to use the T2 THOMSEA trawl. However, the T2 are be abble to collect 2 tons of hydrocarbon or 500 kg of plastic waste.Other reason and proof of effectiveness, our French navy use ours trawls nets to fight against oils spills for a lot of years.

    "remarks": "Description: Storm sewers and feeder streams carry trash-laden runoff to rivers that flow to harbors, bays, and oceans. The Trash Wheel harnesses renewable energy to collect and remove trash and debris from a flowing waterway. Containment booms funnel the floating trash and debris to a conveyor.  A waterwheel provides mechanical power to the conveyor using energy from the river current and solar powered pumps.  The trash is lifted by the conveyor and deposited into a dumpster. The conveyor and waterwheel are mounted on a floating platform that is held in place by pilings.  The dumpster is located on a separate barge, which is pushed by a service vessel to a transfer point for disposal.  A covering structure over the conveyor and dumpster prevents trash from being blown by the wind, protects the equipment, and provides a support structure for the photovoltaic panels. The covering structure is adapted to the specific location to optimize the power generation by the solar panels.  The machine also features an internet based remote control and monitoring system which uses cameras to monitor the trash flow and the dumpster level as well as web based controls which allow the pumps to be turned on or off from a smart phone or a computer from anywhere the internet is available.  Our flagship model in Baltimore collects trash and debris from the Jones Falls River, the largest tributary to the citys Inner Harbor.  Its floating platform is 50 long by 24 wide and constructed of quarter inch epoxy coated steel.  The waterwheel is 14 in diameter and constructed of precision cut galvanized steel.  The 36 long conveyor is submerged to a depth of 2 feet at the upstream end; and fills a 15-18 cubic yard roll-off dumpster.  The solar power is generated from a 3 kilowatt array and powers 9 pumps capable of moving more than 25,000 gallons per hour.  Clearwater Mills also offers both larger and smaller models to fit a wide variety of waterways.  Demonstrated Results:On demand collection of floating trash and debris90% capture rateCapable of unattended remote operationUses renewable power sourcesDoes not harm aquatic wildlifeProvides an opportunity for measurement and analysis of storm water pollutants and upstream mitigation effortsProvides an opportunity for educating the public about the problem of plastic pollution and inspires people to become part of the solutionAn attractive means for addressing an unsightly problemLow operating costsDoes not require specialty service equipment or disposable refuse nets or other containersHigh quality construction for reliability and durabilityPerformance:The first Baltimore Trash Wheel was installed in May of 2014 and has removed approximately 200 tons of trash and debris a year, including more than 45 tons from a single storm event.  It is capable of filling an 18 cubic yard dumpster in less than 2 hours and can remove more than 50,000 pounds of solid waste per day.  The profound effect it has had on the harbor has been noted by nearly everyone who lives, works, or recreates there.  This success has led to three more Trash Wheels for Baltimore.Plastic recovery capacity: Trash Wheels have the capacity to capture and remove 50,000 lbs of trash and debris/day. The percentage of plastics depends on the characteristics of the watershed (urban and/or rural0 and ranges from 20 to 80 percent.",

WFO acquired innovative, yet simple, Trash Catchers, which can remove between 2 and 8 tonnes of floating marine debris per journey. They offer a locally implementable solution to marine litter: attaching nets to fishing boats. The aim is to lease them to businesses and NGOs in areas of waste accumulation. WFO collaborates with companies to create products from the recycled material, making optimal use of available plastic resources. Connecting brands to their trusted network of plastic recyclers and converters, WFO builds the bridge in transforming marine litter into new, sustainable products. WFO lobbies stakeholders at all levels to raise awareness about the issue of marine litter and implements projects to motivate behaviour change. They welcome participation in beach clean-ups or fundraisers. In 2013, WFO successfully lobbied EU policy makers to secure subsidies from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for fishermen to be remunerated for performing marine clean-ups. With the growing global call to action to address the issue of marine litter, WFO feels that they are ideally placed to offer practical answers: their strong connections within the European plastics and recycling industries and extensive experience in recovering, recycling and reusing marine plastics allow them to contribute to cleaner waters.

Lack of clear data on this plastic waste hinders our ability to identify it for recycling or proper disposal, thereby increasing the harmful impact it has on our environment.Ellipsis Earths technology can not only identify plastic waste around the world, but also classify it into different categories such as bottles, containers, sheets, etc. This data can eventually be used by governments and companies to identify plastic accumulation areas and collect the waste for recycling or safe disposal.The data can also be used to inform and educate the public on how and where plastic waste accumulates so that corrective measures can be taken and environment-friendly initiatives can be planned.Ellipsis does this by capturing video and stills from around the world using any source, be it drones, submarines, satellites, or CCTV, and feeding the visuals into its proprietary identification platform. If needed, it can even deploy a drone from its network of over 500 drones to capture images and videos of client sites.All the images are stitched together into a master image for geospatial mapping. The Ellipsis software, through its custom machine learning, can identify plastic with 93% accuracy and 95% certainty. It then classifies the plastic into different categories. The algorithm can also be tailored to identify different types of plastic, brands, and local items.Based on the plastic found in that particular area, it also creates heat maps which can be updated over time. The collected data is then used to prepare content to create awareness about plastic wastage.Buoyed by its success, Ellipsis is launching a mobile app in 2020 for the public. Some of the partners with whom Ellipsis works are National Geographic, Marevivo, BAT, Encounter Edu, and British Science Association, among others.NGOs, government organisations, companies working in the field of plastic management and wastage are the potential clients for Ellipsis Earth.",

    "remarks": "KIMO International works with fishermen to clean the seas, by providing them with large bags to collect litter, which is then recycled or disposed.Marine pollution is one of the biggest environmental concerns worldwide. Not only does it add to the growing pollution levels across the world, but also endangers marine and human lives, who are dependent on oceans for their living. Marine pollution also affects the livelihood of fishermen, through reduced fishing opportunities.The Fishing for Litter project was initiated by KIMO International at a single port in the Netherlands, and it has grown and spread across Europe. European Organisations such as OSPAR have endorsed the program and encourages its 15 member countries to take part in it actively, as a part of its Regional Action Plan against marine litter.The Fishing for Litter team provides fishing vessels with large bags to collect plastics and other debris from the oceans, which gathers in their nets during their fishing activities.When the fishing boats return to port, they offload the collected waste to Fishing for Litter volunteers who either recycle the waste or dispose it suitably.The goal of the Fishing for Litter team is to promote cleaner seas, cleaner beaches, and a better marine environment for all marine lives and humans.More than 1,000 fishing vessels are now involved in this project from 8 countries across Europe and 450 tonnes of plastic and other waste was recovered from the oceans in 2016-17.Encouraged by the response of this initiative, the EU has revised its Port Reception Facilities Directive to make a special provision and space for the Fishing for Litter project. This will encourage more ports and ships to be a part of this project.All ports and shipping vessels that would like the oceans and seas to be cleaner can be a part of this initiative.",

    "remarks": "Ho'ola one works towards removing microplastics from the environment of the beach. Twelve engineering students at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec built a machine for the organization that isolates plastic pieces from the sandy beaches. For several years, the plastic waste that ends on Kamilo Beach has been breaking down into increasingly fine particles. Through the years the Hawai'i Wildlife Fund has managed to dump the bulky debris, but it's the small stuff left behind buried in the sand, that's the remaining problem. Animals confuse plastic particles with insects or other living organisms and ingest them. Plastic therefore enters the food chain and poisons it. The Ho'ola One project team aims to help combat this problem.At University of Sherbrooke, twelve mechanical engineering students have been devoted to this major design project for the last two years of their degree. Leatherman, an aquatic biologist and President of the Hawai'i Wildlife Fund, believes the 'Ho'ola One' - a sand like vacuum designed by Canadian engineering students, is the solution. The machine has a big vacuum that collects the mix of sand and plastics, once the sand is dropped into a water tank, the sand sinks and the plastic floats. The machine works by separating the plastic parts from sand using the density of the diverse components. The plastic pieces are often too small to be handpicked, however with the help of the machine the minute plastic particles are picked.The device has removed roughly 230-pounds of micro-plastics at Kamilo Point (in Hawaï) in a matter of days.",

    "remarks": "Ocean Polymers is committed to turning plastic waste into a valuable resource. The startup is constructing a tanker, named OP3 with a gasification system that has the capacity of processing 200 tons of plastic and waste per day thanks to its onboard machinery which recycles plastic found in the ocean and converts it into hydrogen to power the station. The firm has been working with a team from Imperial College London on the project for the past six years, and it hopes to get up and running in the second half of 2019. During the recycling process on the ship, valuable products such as hydrogen, synthetic gases, building materials and substrates will be created. Their systems will not only remove plastics which are harmful to marine wildlife and enter the food chain but it is self-funding when operating, as a result of the valuable bi-products created.The project will involve smaller boats traveling short distances to take rubbish back to the main ship. Ocean Polymers has secured the patent pending status that has been granted by the US Patent Office on 14th May 2019.  They are in the process of securing intellectual property rights and developing a business plan.",

    "remarks": "Planet Patrol is a charity with an aim to rid the inland waterways of intense plastic pollution, using the collaborative power of community action coupled with the use of disruptive technology to acquire data for research in developing sustainable alternatives.Plastic pollution is becoming an increasingly critical crisis, upsetting food chains and disrupting entire ecosystems. By 2050, the weight of plastic dumped in the ocean is projected to be twice the weight of all the fish and marine life living in it. Single-use plastic is a major source of the plastic crisis, with a mere 1% of single-use plastic bags being returned for recycling and with an average life cycle of just 12 minutes. Inland waterways are usually the origin for dumping waste plastic, which travels and find their way into the oceans. Planet Patrol launched to tackle this environmental catastrophe by organising community-driven clean-ups and collecting data on plastic pollution data using the Planet Patrol App. Every clean-up brings communities together, where waste is seen, photographed, shared on the app and cleared away; serving an equivocal purpose of helping the environment and acquisition of data. The data collected is used for scientific research into waste that escapes into nature, and helps stop the pollution at the first point of contact with the environment. The Planet Patrol app is a real-world tool that provides a platform for data collection and sharing along with community interaction; done by combining the power of citizen science and scientific analysis. The app will enable Planet Patrol to record and analyze data to conduct the world's largest survey of inland plastic pollution, with the River Thames in London alone carrying 18 tonnes of plastic. The users are required to categorize each piece by type and brand before uploading the photos. The app also aids in building a worldwide community of environmentally aware individuals, actively working towards eliminating plastic from our waterways through a collaborative effort. Nearly 300,000 pieces of plastic have been logged from over 80 countries using the #PlanetPatrol App, having intercepted 440 tonnes of plastic waste from inland waterways; that is equivalent to 15 million water bottles. They also organise corporate clean-ups and workshops to accelerate the process of eliminating single-use plastics and embed sustainability in workplaces.",

Blue's aim is to put 10% of the worlds oceans under protection by 2020 and 30% by 2030. They also work to establish sustainable fisheries so fish stocks can begin to recover.Over-fishing represents a major food security issue and has devastating consequences for the fragile biodiversity of our planet. Around 90% of global fish stocks are fully or over-exploited and around 90% of large fish are gone. The consequences are far-reaching, not only for the future of food for a growing global population, but because healthy oceans absorb half the CO2 we produce, this led them come up with The Blue Marine Foundation.Every year, an estimated 640,000 tons of fishing gear is lost in the oceans around the world. Safegear offers a simple solution to stop this plastic pollution.Beacons are being designed to fit onto existing fishing gear markers that normally comprise of a float, bamboo pole, and flag. It allows fishing vessels to inexpensively monitor their gear at sea, receive alerts if the gear starts to move, and contact vessels in the area. If gear is lost due to towing or bad weather, the beacon allows the fishing vessel to track the gear and recover it.These electronic beacons will also allow the fishing gear markers to be viewed on the bridge, wheelhouse and cockpit plotters of other marine traffic so they can avoid the hazard. Existing markers are almost impossible to see at night and often difficult in daylight.The Blue Marine Foundation has won various awards and recognitions -In 2014 BLUE won NGO of the Year in the PEA (People Environment Achievement) Awards in recognition that it was getting results where they matter most. In 2015 BLUE won four PEA Awards as part of the GB Oceans Coalition including Overall Champion.",

    "remarks": "SeaChange is seeking to solve the marine plastics problem and create an end game for ocean plastics.Only 9% of the 400 million tons of plastic produced globally each year is recycled. Much of that unrecycled plastic ends up in oceans with approximately one dump truck load of plastic is put into the ocean every minute. When exposed to the sun, these plastics can degrade into harmful microplastics. SeaChange wants to act before this can happen and stop the pollution cycle by removing plastics from the waste stream.Using a plasma enhanced melter (PEM), SeaChange wants to collect ocean plastics and convert them into a non-toxic, inert glass that is safe for humans and marine life. The PEM breaks down the molecular structure of plastics at temperatures up to 18,000°F. The process converts 5 tons of plastic a day into clean syngas and glass. The syngas can be used for fuel. SeaChange plans on utilizing the PEM technology on ships that can be deployed in areas with a large amount of plastic waste.Phase 1 of their mission is focused on deploying SeaChange ships in the Indonesian archipelago where 1.42 million tons of plastic leak into the ocean every year. SeaChange utilizes InEnTec's PEM system.",

    "remarks": "Ashored develops sustainability-enabling technologies for the commercial fishing industry. Ashored is currently developing a rope on-command (ROC) fishing system to minimize the risk of whale entanglements and trap loss/damage, while allowing fishers to fish in zones closed to fixed fishing gear. Marine animal entanglements and ghost fishing are creating huge issues in oceans. Entanglements are the leading cause of death for North Atlantic Right Whales and 83% of the population has visible scars from fishing gear entanglement. To remedy this, Ashored is developing new fishing systems to allow fishing to continue while creating safer conditions for whales.Ashoreds underwater buoy/rope releases work with existing lobster/crab traps/trawl lines and allow for said gear to be activated via acoustics (or a backup timer) to the surface. Once the buoy and connecting rope rise to the surface, fishermen can use existing onboard equipment and processes to retrieve the gear and prepare it for redeployment. Ashoreds ROC fishing systems include a rope containment and release module (MOBI) that also uses sensors to collect and transmit data to an onboard gear tracking system (ATLAS). ATLAS consists of Ashoreds ATLAS+ software and smart tagging to reduce gear loss and allow fishers to automate the tracking of gear and logging of catch information.",

    "remarks": "Norton Point is an eyewear brand based on the island of Martha's Vineyard, MA and was founded in 2015 with a goal to make sustainable sunglasses from ocean plastic and plant based materials.Norton Point's team believe that the 8 million metric tons of plastic flowing into our oceans is one of our planet's greatest environmental challenges, and they have chosen to become part of the solution.The company has developed the first line of eyewear made from recovered high-density-polyethylene (HDPE) ocean plastics. For every product sold Norton Point is committing to clean-up one pound of plastic from the ocean. The team has also chosen to give back 5% of net profits to global clean-up, education, and remediation practices. Getting started was no easy task. Luckily they had the right past work and life experiences to navigate the various obstacles and attract key partners like The Plastic Bank. Finding ocean plastic and securing high-quality manufacturers was complicated. But they were able to find partners who were willing to take a risk on their dream and help them figure out how to make sunglasses from recovered ocean plastic.",

    "remarks": "To catalyse zero plastic waste leadership, the 3R Initiative (3RI) is developing a market-based approach that will scale up recovery and recycling activities and increase accountability for plastic waste reduction efforts around the world. The 3RI supports a market for plastic credits which will transparently and sustainably increase the value of plastic and beverage carton waste, and incentivize new activities that support the circular economy. The 3RI supports the following three elements:The Guidelines for Corporate Plastic Stewardship facilitate corporate plastic footprint assessment and communication of credible mitigation actions, enabling companies to meet leadership commitments. The Guidelines, which the 3RI developed in coordination with South Pole (a 3RI member), EA and Quantis, share principles of credible corporate plastic stewardship programs, key metrics for accounting for plastic footprint and leakage, guidance for the appropriate implementation of a range of plastic waste mitigation activities, and leadership claims related to plastic waste and circularity.     The Plastic Waste Reduction Standard (Plastic Standard) is an efficient and powerful means of supporting activities that verifiably reduce plastic in the environment anywhere in the world. The Plastic Standard, developed by Verra with the support of the 3R Initiative, establishes consistent accounting and verification processes for plastic waste collection and/or recycling activities and enables the issuance of credits for plastic collected and recycled above baseline rates. The independently-audited Plastic Standard includes significant social and environmental safeguards.     The Circular Action Hub: a platform that connects local waste management projects and activities with companies and investors willing to support, accelerate and strengthen a more effective and socially-responsible circular economy. The Circular Action Hub, developed and managed by BVRio, aims to create demand, price discovery and liquidity for 3R Initiative pilots and Plastic Credits certified to the Plastic Waste Reduction Standard. It promotes a wide range of activities and funding pathways, including sponsorship, investment, or credit purchase.",
