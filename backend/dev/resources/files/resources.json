A global solution for the problem of plastic waste entering the ocean requires deployment of diverse interventions in rivers, so each intervention will be tailored to the equally diverse riverine and cultural environments where plastic waste is found. Recipients of funding were selected through a competitive request for proposals process that took place May-July 2019. The Benioff Ocean Initiative received proposals for 30 projects across 5 continents and 16 countries. Due to the high volume of exciting and innovative proposals, they expanded the program from 1 to 9 projects, creating a global network of organizations working collaboratively to eliminate river plastic waste. Each year a cycle of funding focuses on a new oceans issue, so the precise topic varies from year to year.",

ProBLUE supports implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) and is fully aligned with the World Banks twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing the income and welfare of the poor in a sustainable way. ProBLUE is part of the World Banks overall Blue Economy program, which takes a multi-pronged, coordinated approach to ensuring the protection and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources. ProBLUE focuses on four key themes: the management of fisheries and aquaculture; the threats posed to ocean health by marine pollution, including litter and plastics; the sustainable development of key oceanic sectors such as tourism, maritime transport and off-shore renewable energy; and building the capacity of governments to manage their marine and coastal resources in an integrated fashion to deliver more and long-lasting benefits to countries and communities, including the role of nature-based solutions to climate change.",

The project will work to minimize marine litter, raise awareness on plastic pollution and improve the regions waste management systems. The project, funded by the Sweden International Development Agency (Sida) and implemented by UN Environment Programme and COBSEA, will involve stakeholders throughout the plastic value chain, from the plastic producers to the waste managers to those in coastal communities suffering most the impacts of plastic pollution, to ensure less plastic leaks through waste management systems.To reduce waste, UN Environment and COBSEA will be working with research institutions, companies, government bodies and civil society to reduce the use of the most harmful and difficult to recycle plastic, boost collection and recycling of high-value plastic such as PET, and generate region-wide public awareness and support for better plastic pollution policies. The scientific basis for addressing marine litter will be strengthened, by collecting and analyzing data on plastic leakage and marine litter at local, national and regional levels. UN Environment, COBSEA and partners will use this baseline data to help all stakeholders in the plastic lifecycle develop evidence-based policies and plans that will reduce the amount of marine litter flowing from the region.",

The focus of implementation is on regional cooperation and knowledge sharing between national institutions, communities and companies. The aim is to conserve natural and economic resources. At a regional level, the project also seeks to establish a common understanding of the issue and associated action plan. A learning and exchange platform enables skills to be built up across national boundaries. At a national level, the project supports legislative processes to reduce marine litter, with a particular focus on plastics. At the same time, implementation and monitoring structures will be strengthened. The ability to estimate economic follow-on costs and to set priorities for the respective country plays an important part in political debates. At a local level, the project aims to put into practice measures to reduce the leakage of plastics into the Mediterranean Sea. Partner communities and organisations in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro receive support in the form of the requisite equipment (such as containers for collecting recycling materials separately), which helps to improve the collection of recycling materials and waste.",

    "summary": "A circular economy is a global economic model that aims to decouple economic growth and development from the consumption of finite resources. Increasingly, companies see tremendous opportunity in this model, as it not only allows them to capture additional value from their products and materials, but also to mitigate risks from material price volatility and material supply. Until now, there has been no established way of measuring how effective a company is in making the transition from linear to circular models , nor have there been any supporting tools. The Circularity Indicators Project aims to address this gap and has developed indicators that assess how well a product or company performs in the context of a circular economy, thereby allowing companies to estimate how advanced they are on their journey from linear to circular. The developed indexes consist of a main indicator, the Material Circularity Indicator, measuring how restorative the material flows of a product or company are, and complementary indicato rs that allow additional impacts and risks to be taken into account. The indicators can be used as decision - making tool for designers, but might also be used for several other purposes including internal reporting, procurement decisions and the evaluation or rating of companies. In addition to the methodology, the Circularity Indicators Project has contributed to the development of a web - based measurement system for products, providing businesses with the tools required to track their progress in delivering a circular economy based business model. The purpose of this methodology paper is to describe the thinking behind this approach, alongside a comprehensive derivation of the equations used to calculate the Material Circularity Indicator.",

    "year": 2016,
    "summary": "This report should support EU Member States in the implementation of monitoring programmes and plan of measures to act upon marine litter. The reduction of marine litter pollution poses a complex challenge for environmental policies, requiring adjustments in human behaviour as well as in the different phases of the life-cycle of products and access multiple economic sectors. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires European Member States to monitor marine litter and implement programmes of measures to reduce its occurrence. A crucial step in monitoring and effectively addressing marine litter is the identification of the origin and the pathways that lead to litter entering the marine environment. A wide variety of methods have been used over the years to determine the sources of marine litter, from simple counts of items believed to originate from a given source to more complex statistical methods. This report provides a brief overview of the main methods used and outlines one of the most promising approaches for determining sources – a Matrix Score Technique based on likelihoods, which considers the possibility that specific items originate from more than one source. Furthermore, it presents aseries of other parameters that can be used to analyse data-sets,  with regard to the use, origin and risk of items recorded in the marine or coastal environments. These can further support decision-making when considering preventive measures. Finally, recommendations to help the process of identification of sources are given, from the early stage of data collection and site characterization to bringing in the knowledge of local stakeholders to better determine where litter is coming from and what needs to be done to prevent it.",

    "summary": "The Guidance Note contains a review of the overall policies and principles applying to planning in the field of waste management, including waste prevention, in the EU. This includes a review of legislation in force, and in some fields practical methods are indicated for fleshing out the framework put in place by the EU and the various Member States for the contents of management plans. Furthermore, a framework — or step-by-step model — is presented as a source of inspiration for drawing up an individual waste management plan. Waste management planning is the cornerstone of any national, regional or local policy on waste management. The establishment of a plan allows taking stock of the existing situation, defining the objectives that need to be met, formulating appropriate strategies, and identifying the necessary implementation means. The drawing up of waste management plans is an obligation of EU Member States and is required by Article 28 of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD). Member States can ask the regional or local authorities to draw up regional or local plans. The plans shall cover the entire geographical territory of a Member State and need to be in line with the provisions of Article 1 WFD (protection of environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste and by reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use), Article 4 WFD (the waste management hierarchy), Article 13 WFD (protection of human health and environment), and Article 16 WFD (principles of self-sufficiency and proximity). Article 28(3) WFD lists the mandatory elements of a waste management plan. Article 28(4) WFD lists additional elements which may be contained in the plan.",

It includes the current scientific and technical background regarding litter in river systems, their flow regime and basic properties. The document aims to provide recommendations for monitoring approaches and methodologies. It also provides indications on the issues which need to be further developed in a collaborative approach. An extensive literature review has been performed in order to identify the existing options for the monitoring of litter items in rivers. Different monitoring methods are used in two environmental compartments: river water bodies and riverbanks. For a river water body, the river water surface can be monitored by visual observation and image acquisition, while collection methodologies for the water column include the use of retaining structures and sampling using grids, nets and filtration systems (with different mesh sizes and openings) at different water depths. Riverbank monitoring comprises the observation and eventual collection of litter items and sediment samples from the riverbanks. Methodologies are described and technical details are reported whenever available.",

    "year": 2019,
    "summary": "This briefing provides an overview of exports of plastic waste from the 28 EU Member States (EU-28) to other countries and discusses its possible consequences and opportunities. It  builds on a report by the EEAs European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE). Annual global plastic production has increased from 2 to 380 million tonnes since 1950 and is projected to double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. European countries lack the capacity to manage growing amounts of plastic waste in circular and sustainable ways. In early 2019, the EU exported around 150 000 tonnes of plastic waste per month. This figure was about twice as high in 2015 and 2016 - up to 300.000 tons monthly - when exports went to China and Hong Kong primarily. Import restrictions are the reason for the decrease and shift in exports of plastic waste to other countries in Asia. Poor management of plastic waste has negative environmental and climate effects, such as deposits of plastic and microplastics appearing on land and in rivers and oceans worldwide. Plastic contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions from production and from waste management, and to harmful effects from chemicals and water use. There is little knowledge or transparency about how plastic waste imported from the EU is managed in other countries. Recent restrictions on imports of plastic waste in China, combined with some types of plastic being added to the Basel Convention, is likely to further decrease EU exports. This poses the risk of increased incineration and landfilling of plastic waste in Europe. The EU must find circular and climate-friendly ways of managing its plastic waste e.g. by increasing reuse and recycling.",

One of plastics greatest properties, its durability, is also one of the main reasons that plastics present a threat to the marine environment. To understand this issue better, GESAMP was tasked to conduct a global assessment, based on published information, of the sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment.",

It follows publication of the first assessment report in this series in April 2015 (GESAMP 2015). The issue of marine plastic litter was raised during the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in June 2014. Delegates from 160 countries adopted Resolution 1/6 on Marine plastic debris and microplastics (Annex I). The resolution welcomed the work being undertaken by GESAMP on microplastics and requested the Executive Director of UNEP to carry out a study on marine plastics and microplastics. This was to be based on a combination of existing and new studies, including WG40. This provided the motivation for GESAMP to revise the original terms of reference to reflect both the request from UNEP to contribute to the UNEA study, and the key recommendations from the WG40 2015 report.",

    "summary": "This study deals with the question of how decision-makers can improve their municipal solid waste management systems and move towards a circular economy in order to prevent plastic leakage into waterways and the ocean. It focuses on plastic waste from human settlements as a substantial share of marine litter consists of plastics stemming from land-based sources. A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

The assessment says that prevention of the most environmentally harmful plastic types, such as single-use plastics and non-recyclable plastic products should be prioritised. While fees on plastic shopping bags have led to notable results in reducing their use and waste in many countries, such measures should also be applied to other types of plastic products, the report says, for example to plastic packaging waste, which is the single largest plastic waste stream in Europe.",

The goal of the Partnership is to improve and promote the environmentally sound management of plastic waste at the global, regional and national levels and prevent and minimize its generation. It is intended to reduce significantly and, in the long-term, eliminate, the discharge of plastic waste and microplastics into the environment, in particular the marine environment. The Partnership covers all plastic waste, including waste containing plastics, generated nationally and disposed of at the national level, as well as those which are imported or exported for waste management operations, taking into account the entire life-cycle of plastics. The Partnership promotes action and encourages dialogue between governments, regional and local authorities, Regional Seas Programmes, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and academia towards the ultimate goal of reducing significantly and, in the long-term, eliminating the discharge of plastic waste and microplastics into the environment, in particular the marine environment. Promote the development of policy, regulation and strategies on the prevention and minimization of plastic waste, in particular in relation to single-use plastics, inter alia, via better design and innovation to improve durability, reusability, reparability and recyclability of plastics and to avoid hazardous substances in plastics and on environmentally sound management of plastic waste, taking into account the entire life cycle of plastics.",

Prevention may include strict avoidance, source reduction and direct reuse. Minimization includes reuse, recycling and recovery. Recycling and recovery, however, are not addressed in this document as they are the subject of a large number of other guidance documents under the Basel Convention, such as technical guidelines . 9. The Basel Convention addresses hazardous waste and other wastes. In the context of the Convention, “other wastes” include wastes collected from households. This document therefore also addresses the prevention and reuse of wastes from households. Most of the guidance provided in this document is of a general nature and could apply to both hazardous wastes and wastes from households.",

The report finds that most existing methodologies focus on assessment of plastic usage, waste or recycling rates. While many methodologies are being developed, there is currently methodology for assessing impacts in a comprehensive manner that allows measurement of trade-offs between different impact categories – for example related to climate and ecosystem damage.

The project aimed at capitalizing on growing a baseline of knowledge on marine plastics sources, pathways and environmental impacts, to recommend actions to build circularity and reduce pollution for the plastic sector. Under this project, a roadmap to circular economy for plastics was developed by UNEP in collaboration with partners. UNEP also developed a report to take stock of the extent of knowledge on plastics in marine environment, a global plastic value chain mapping report and a to-be-published recommendations for action report. 2 multi-stakeholder consultation workshops were held by UNEP to map the plastic value chain and identify recommended actions towards circular economy for plastics. Key elements include: material redesign that makes plastics recyclable from inception; circular product and packaging design; effective and clean technologies and infrastructure to collect, recycle and reduce the current amount of plastics waste; and networks of stakeholders – governments, policy makers, investors, producers, recyclers and consumers – to build new models of sustainable consumption and production based on circular reduce-reuse-recycle-based economies.",

The findings should be used to derive a per capita budget for plastics that defines the maximum ecologically compatible quantity of emissions per person. In addition, methods are being developed to adequately reflect the potential effects of macro- and microplastic emissions in eco-assessments. The project results create a quantitative basis for future political decision-making processes. The PlasticBudget project is therefore divided into two parts: 1) Development of a budget approach that can be used to determine the permissible global total quantities in water bodies and the annual per capita emissions of plastics into the environment. 2) Development of an impact assessment methodology with corresponding environmental indicators in order to consider the plastic waste problem in environmental auditing. Similar to the balance calculation for greenhouse gases in the climate problem, reference variables such as plastic equivalents are developed as a basis for decision-making.",

It focuses on plastic waste from human settlements as a substantial share of marine litter consists of plastics stemming from land-based sources. A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. | 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

    "summary": "The ISWA Plastic Waste Pollution Calculator is a toolkit developed by the University of Leeds on behalf of the Task Force on Marine Litter, an initiative of ISWA . Its objective is to allow municipalities, NGOs and governments to map the flow over time of macro-sized plastic waste items throughout their region, from the point of generation to their eventual disposal or fate in the environment. By answering a series of questions on the local socio-economic, environmental and technical conditions, particularly regarding the details of waste and resources management techniques and infrastructure, the calculator is able to identify mechanisms by which plastic items may become mismanaged and subsequently transported to waterways based on each items physical properties . As the flow of mass is mapped throughout the waste management system, this allows the quantification of plastic pollution sources and identification of prioritised interventions .The tool is applied at a district (neighbourhood) level, however results can be combined to analyse waste flows over larger regions or on a watershed level. Two levels of assessment, broad and detailed, allow greater flexibility based on local requirements and resources.",

It builds upon the inventory of different plastic losses over the life cycle of businesses or products. It cross-links the concepts of plastic leakage (inventory), plastic circularity (fraction of plastic recycled or restored in biological cycles) and plastic materiality (ratio of the functionality/added value versus potential impacts). Loss rates and plastic fate are based on gross assumptions. The proposed methodology encompasses both mis-managed plastic waste and microplastics from different sources. It provides default emission factors for key sectors. Two case studies are under development, in the Mediterranean and Baltic regions.",

The objective is to refine the inventory method for plastic flows released into the environment and develop generic datasets, enabling use of the methodology by companies. The approach is targeting both the macro-component from mismanaged wastes and microplastics from different sources. It is intended to complement the LCA framework with better inventory data for plastics and prepare a dedicated impact assessment method for marine plastics. The project gathers 25 companies and includes a strategic committee (IUCN, UN Environment and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development), as well as an advisory board composed of 15 universities or NGO members.

The proposed project has the potential to reduce plastic leakage to the environment and unlock new economic opportunities - both of which are urgently needed for South Africa. The project would consist of two components: one will support the identification and implementation of opportunities for sustainable alternative materials, including bioplastics, and the second will support the implementation of the Industry Waste Management Plan of the plastic packaging industry by building up the capacity and integration of the informal waste sector; with a view to enhance waste separation at source to increase the quality and amount of collected recyclables.",

    "type": "Technical Resource",
    "year": 2020,
    "summary": "Measures against marine litter require quantitative data for the assessment of litter abundance, trends and distribution. While beach litter monitoring has been ongoing in some European areas since years, so far it was yet not possible to obtain an overview and to analyse litter abundance, litter category distribution and trends at the different spatial scales from local to EU. Therefore, the EU Marine Directors and the Marine Strategy Coordination Group mandated, in the context of the MSFD implementation, to the MSFD Technical Group on Marine Litter and the JRC, the compilation and analysis of an EU beach litter dataset. Aim was to derive EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines at different spatial levels. After collection of European beach litter data from EU Member States via the EMODNET chemistry module database, harmonisation of data formats and data clean-up, a 2012-2016 dataset was derived. Following the spatio-temporal aggregation of data. The application of agreed scenario parameters has enabled the calculation of marine beach litter baselines for the years 2015 and 2016 at spatial scales ranging from country and country –region level to sub-regional, regional and EU level. Litter categories have been aggregated and allow analysis of group categories up to EU level, whereas the analysis of single categories could not include all received data due to non-comparable litter type category descriptions. and the identification of possible litter category analysis, different scenarios for baseline setting have been tested and evaluated. The resulting set of baselines enables the future monitoring of progress in reduction, as well as compliance checking developed using the dataset. Furthermore, it provides valuable information for future improving harmonised monitoring through updated guidance, common data treatment and agreed data reporting formats. Beach litter abundance has been found to be very high in large areas of Europe, requiring joint and strong action in Europe and with the neighbours in shared marine basins.",

    "summary": "La basura marina se ha convertido en un problema mundial que impacta negativamente la biodiversidad, la salud pública, y las actividades productivas y recreativas que se desarrollan en costas y océanos. Históricamente el mar ha sido utilizado como receptor de basura. Sin embargo, las dimensiones de la descarga son impresionantes. La Academia de Ciencias de Estados Unidos de Norteamérica ha estimado que 6.4 millones de toneladas de basura entran al océano cada año. A nivel internacional se han desarrollado múltiples acciones para contrarrestar el impacto de la basura marina. Por ejemplo, el Convenio de MARPOL 73/78 incluye requerimieEl Programa Regional para la gestión integral de la basura marina en el Pacífico Sudeste se enfoca en estosasuntos clave y plantea un curso de acción para los próximos ocho años, en el marco del Protocolo para laProtección del Pacífico Sudeste contra la Contaminación Proveniente de Fuentes Terrestres. El objetivo generaldel programa es minimizar la descarga de residuos persistentes de fuentes terrestres y marinas en el OcéanoPacífico Sudeste, y está integrado por siete objetivos específicos:Objetivo específico 1. Ampliar la cobertura de los sistemas de recolección de basura en los municipios costeros yasegurar que los procedimientos de disposición de residuos sólidos impidan la liberación de materialespersistentes al medio.Objetivo específico 2. Erradicar la descarga de basuras persistentes desde buques.Objetivo específico 3. Minimizar la disposición de restos de artes y aparejos de pesca en las costas y el océano.Objetivo específico 4. Conocer los volúmenes de producción, patrones de distribución y acumulación, e impactosde la basura marina en la región.Objetivo específico 5. Incluir la problemática de la basura marina en las agendas de temas prioritarios de lospaíses de la región.Objetivo específico 6. Reducir el uso de envases y envolturas desechables de materiales persistentes queeventualmente pueden convertirse en basura marina.Objetivo específico 7. Establecer una política regional sobre basura marina.Para cada objetivo específico se proponen una serie de acciones de nivel nacional y acciones regionales que lospaíses deben abordar en conjunto.ntos para el manejo de basura producida en buques; el Protocolo para la Protección del Pacífico Sudeste contra la Contaminación Proveniente de Fuentes Terrestres, adoptado por los países del Pacífico Sudeste en 19832, incluye la obligación de combatir la contaminación de varias sustancias incluyendo residuos persistentes. El Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Medio Ambiente (PNUMA) resalta que aún existen deficiencias en la implementación de los acuerdos internacionales y regionales al respecto, así como limitaciones para el manejo de los residuos persistentes.",

Recognizing this dynamic is fundamental to think, plan  and act to guarantee a viable future. For FUNBIO, the support to projects aiming for ocean knowledge  and conservation has always been a priority. And it is with great satisfaction that we take part in the  initiative that has generated the present São Paulo Strategic Plan for Monitoring and Assessment  of Marine Litter (PEMALM), a partnership involving the University of São Paulo, the Norwegian  Embassy and the Secretariat of Infrastructure and Environment of the State of São Paulo. Since the early days of its activities, in 1996, FUNBIO has supported the creation and  strengthening of marine and coastal protected areas. This also extends to studies about species, coastal  and marine environments, and fishery resources. The plan represents an important step towards the  creation of an information database in the state of São Paulo, which can subsidize future means to  combat marine litter. A global and growing challenge that requires equally global, and ever-increasing,  knowledge and effort from all of society for mitigation.",

    "summary": "Marine debris touches every corner of the world, from remote islands to the worlds largest cities, and it is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of the issue. However, there is hope. Marine debris is a human-caused problem and, therefore, has human solutions. As public awareness of and interest in marine debris continues to grow, so does the community of people working to address the issue. Since the inception of the NOAA Marine Debris Program in 2006, NOAA has strived to help find solutions to the marine debris problem. The fiscal year 2021-2025 Strategic Plan highlights how the MDP will work with dedicated staff and partners for the next five years to make a measurable change toward reaching our vision: the global ocean and its coasts free from the impacts of marine debris. Six goals will guide the next five years: prevention, removal, research, response, coordination, and a new goal: monitoring and detection. The fiscal year 2021-2025 Strategic Plan also includes a new focus on using innovative technology and a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity.This plan will drive daily operations, set annual milestones, and challenge the MDP to reach more ambitious goals than ever previously set. The path forward is one filled with hope for a healthier ocean and healthier planet.",
