This global network will consist of several interdisciplinary teams working around the world to pilot technologies for physical capture of plastic waste in highly-polluted rivers, and to catalyze policy-based, infrastructural, and societal change to reduce plastic waste inputs to those rivers. A global solution for the problem of plastic waste entering the ocean requires deployment of diverse interventions in rivers, so each intervention will be tailored to the equally diverse riverine and cultural environments where plastic waste is found.Recipients of funding were selected through a competitive request for proposals process that took place May-July 2019. The Benioff Ocean Initiative received proposals for 30 projects across 5 continents and 16 countries. Due to the high volume of exciting and innovative proposals, we expanded the program from 1 to 9 projects, creating a global network of organizations working collaboratively to eliminate river plastic waste. Each year a cycle of funding focuses on a new oceans issue, so the precise topic varies from year to year.",

Waste consisting of plastics can contribute to the POPs challenge as POPs contained in plastics can be released in the environment including oceans, if not properly managed. Marine litter in the form of micro-plastics to a significant extent derives from land-based activities and should also be seen in the context of waste management issues dealt with under this focal area. Recognizing the need to transform the entire life cycle of plastics to reduce marine plastic pollution, the GEF will invest in a few strategic Circular Economy initiatives to promote the adoption of closed loop production and consumption patterns instead of traditional linear take-make-waste approaches. Investments will be focusing on public/ private investments to transform the plastic life cycle.",

ProBLUE supports implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) and is fully aligned with the World Banks twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing the income and welfare of the poor in a sustainable way. ProBLUE is part of the World Banks overall Blue Economy program, which takes a multi-pronged, coordinated approach to ensuring the protection and sustainable use of marine and coastal resources. ProBLUE focuses on four key themes:the management of fisheries and aquaculture, the threats posed to ocean health by marine pollution, including litter and plastics, the sustainable development of key oceanic sectors such as tourism, maritime transport and off-shore renewable energy and building the capacity of governments to manage their marine and coastal resources in an integrated fashion to deliver more and long-lasting benefits to countries and communities, including the role of nature-based solutions to climate change.",

This support includes a partial World Bank guarantee ($5 million) and a concessional loan from the Global Environment Facility ($5 million), which will partially subsidize payment of the bond coupons. These credit enhancement instruments allowed for a reduction of the price of the bond by partially derisking the investment of the impact investors, but also by reducing the effective interest rate for Seychelles by subsidizing the coupons.The proceeds will be used to capitalize a Blue Grants Fund ($3 million) and a Blue Investment Fund ($12 million), each of which will provide financing for marine and ocean-related activities that contribute to the transition to sustainable fishers. These proceeds will be managed by the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT), which will administer grants from the Blue Grants Fund, and the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS), which will administer loans from the Blue Investment Fund.

These regional bodies will also be able to identify further opportunities to scale up the blueprints application, which can be used by any island country.",

At a regional level, the project also seeks to establish a common understanding of the issue and associated action plan. A learning and exchange platform enables skills to be built up across national boundaries. At a national level, the project supports legislative processes to reduce marine litter, with a particular focus on plastics. At the same time, implementation and monitoring structures will be strengthened. The ability to estimate economic follow-on costs and to set priorities for the respective country plays an important part in political debates. At a local level, the project aims to put into practice measures to reduce the leakage of plastics into the Mediterranean Sea. Partner communities and organisations in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro receive support in the form of the requisite equipment (such as containers for collecting recycling materials separately), which helps to improve the collection of recycling materials and waste.",

There is considerable scope to reduce waste and increase the recovery of useful resources from waste. Lifting our performance in recovering economic value from waste also provides environmental, social and cultural benefits and reduces the risks of harm from waste. This will require investment in infrastructure and systems for waste minimisation and developing educational and promotional capacity. The purpose of the fund is to provide some of the funding to ensure that this occurs. The waste disposal levy provides the revenue for the fund.",

Increasingly, companies see tremendous opportunity in this model, as it not only allows them to capture additional value from their products and materials, but also to mitigate risks from material price volatility and material supply. Until now, there has been no established way of measuring how effective a company is in making the transition from linear to circular models , nor have there been any supporting tools. The Circularity Indicators Project aims to address this gap and has developed indicators that assess how well a product or company performs in the context of a circular economy, thereby allowing companies to esti mate how advanced they are on their journey from linear to circular. The developed indexes consist of a main indicator, the Material Circularity Indicator, measuring how restorative the material flows of a product or company are, and complementary indicato rs that allow additional impacts and risks to be taken into account. The indicators can be used as decision - making tool for designers, but might also be used for several other purposes including internal reporting, procurement decisions and the evaluation or rating of companies. In addition to the methodology, the Circularity Indicators Project has contributed to the development of a web - based measurement system for products, providing businesses with the tools required to track their progress in delivering a circular economy based business model. The purpose of this methodology paper is to describe the thinking behind this approach, alongside a comprehensive derivation of the equations used to calculate the Material Circularity Indicator",

        "summary": "Marine litter can impact organisms at different levels of biological organization and habitats in a number of ways namely: through entanglement in, or ingestion of, litter items by individuals, resulting in death and/or severe suffering; through chemical and microbial transfer; as a vector for transport of biota and by altering or modifying assemblages of species. Marine litter is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems but also carries a risk to human health and has significant implications to human welfare, impacting negatively vital economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, aquaculture or energy supply and bringing economic losses to individuals, enterprises and communities. This technical report aims to provide clear insight about the major negative impacts from marine litter by describing the mechanisms of harm. Further it provides reflexions about the evidence for harm from marine litter to biota, while also considering the socioeconomic effects, including the influence of marine litter on ecosystem services. General conclusions highlight that understanding the risks and uncertainties with regard to the harm caused by marine litter is closely associated with the precautionary principle. The collected evidence in this report can be regarded as a supporting step to define harm and to provide an evidence base for the various actions needed to be implemented by decision-makers. This improved knowledge about the scale of the harmful effects of marine litter will further support EU Member States (MSs) and Regional Seas Conventions (RSCs) to implement their programme of measures, regional action plan and assessments.

        "summary": "The reduction of marine litter pollution poses a complex challenge for environmental policies, requiring adjustments in human behaviour as well as in the different phases of the life-cycle of products and access multiple economic sectors. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires European Member States to monitor marine litter and implement programmes of measures to reduce its occurrence. A crucial step in monitoring and effectively addressing marine litter is the identification of the origin and the pathways that lead to litter entering the marine environment. A given site or region can be subject to litter pollution from a number of sources, which can be local, regional or even distant, as litter can be transported to a specific area by ocean currents and wind drift. For this reason, pinpointing the origin of the different items that make up marine litter is a difficult task and will always have an inherent degree of associated uncertainty. The TG Litter has published a report on the methodologies for identification of litter sources \u2013 a Matrix Score Technique based on likelihoods, which considers the possibility that specific items originate from more than one source. Furthermore, it presents a series of other parameters that can be used to analyse data-sets, with regard to the use, origin and risk of items recorded in the marine or coastal environments. These can further support decision-making when considering preventive measures. Finally, recommendations to help the process of identification of sources are given, from the early stage of data collection and site characterization to bringing in the knowledge of local stakeholders to better determine where litter is coming from and what needs to be done to prevent it.",

Furthermore, there are no harmonised methodologies for providing quantitative data for comparable assessments of riverine litter. This technical report compiles the options for monitoring riverine litter and quantifying litter fluxes, focusing on anthropogenic litter. It includes the current scientific and technical background regarding litter in river systems, their flow regime and basic properties. The document aims to provide recommendations for monitoring approaches and methodologies. It also provides indications on the issues which need to be further developed in a collaborative approach. An extensive literature review has been performed in order to identify the existing options for the monitoring of litter items in rivers. Different monitoring methods are used in two environmental compartments: river water bodies and riverbanks. For a river water body, the river water surface can be monitored by visual observation and image acquisition, while collection methodologies for the water column include the use of retaining structures and sampling using grids, nets and filtration systems (with different mesh sizes and openings) at different water depths. Riverbank monitoring comprises the observation and eventual collection of litter items and sediment samples from the riverbanks. Methodologies are described and technical details are reported whenever available.",

        "summary": "Annual global plastic production has increased from 2 to 380 million tonnes since 1950 and is projected to double by 2035 and almost quadruple by 2050. European countries lack the capacity to manage growing amounts of plastic waste in circular and sustainable ways. In early 2019, the EU exported around 150 000 tonnes of plastic waste per month. This figure was about twice as high in 2015 and 2016 - up to 300.000 tons monthly - when exports went to China and Hong Kong primarily. Import restrictions are the reason for the decrease and shift in exports of plastic waste to other countries in Asia. Poor management of plastic waste has negative environmental and climate effects, such as deposits of plastic and microplastics appearing on land and in rivers and oceans worldwide. Plastic contributes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions from production and from waste management, and to harmful effects from chemicals and water use. There is little knowledge or transparency about how plastic waste imported from the EU is managed in other countries. Recent restrictions on imports of plastic waste in China, combined with some types of plastic being added to the Basel Convention, is likely to further decrease EU exports. This poses the risk of increased incineration and landfilling of plastic waste in Europe. The EU must find circular and climate-friendly ways of managing its plastic waste e.g. by increasing reuse and recycling.",

A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

The Basel Convention Plastic Waste Partnership was established by the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention at its fourteenth meeting held in Geneva in 2019. The goal of the Partnership is to improve and promote the environmentally sound management of plastic waste at the global, regional and national levels and prevent and minimize its generation. It is intended to reduce significantly and, in the long-term, eliminate, the discharge of plastic waste and microplastics into the environment, in particular the marine environment. The Partnership covers all plastic waste, including waste containing plastics, generated nationally and disposed of at the national level, as well as those which are imported or exported for waste management operations, taking into account the entire life-cycle of plastics. The Partnership promotes action and encourages dialogue between governments, regional and local authorities, Regional Seas Programmes, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and academia towards the ultimate goal of reducing significantly and, in the long-term, eliminating the discharge of plastic waste and microplastics into the environment, in particular the marine environment. Promote the development of policy, regulation and strategies on the prevention and minimization of plastic waste, in particular in relation to single-use plastics, inter alia, via better design and innovation to improve durability, reusability, reparability and recyclability of plastics and to avoid hazardous substances in plastics and on environmentally sound management of plastic waste, taking into account the entire life cycle of plastics",

It provides guidance on developing strategies and measures, both mandatory and voluntary, to achieve the prevention, minimization and reuse of hazardous wastes and other wastes. Prevention may include strict avoidance, source reduction and direct reuse. Minimization includes reuse, recycling and recovery. Recycling and recovery, however, are not addressed in this document as they are the subject of a large number of other guidance documents under the Basel Convention, such as technical guidelines . 9. The Basel Convention addresses hazardous waste and other wastes. In the context of the Convention, \u201cother wastes\u201d include wastes collected from households. This document therefore also addresses the prevention and reuse of wastes from households. Most of the guidance provided in this document is of a general nature and could apply to both hazardous wastes and wastes from households.",

It also provides an overview of the state of knowledge for impact assessment and monetary valuation methodologies, along with a glossary of key terms related to plastics, marine plastics and environmental footprints. The review of methodologies covers 19 that had been identified as of early 2019. An analysis reveals two groups of methodologies: the first comprises those that identify plastic waste streams and recycling rates at the national or business level; the second comprises methodologies that focus on pathway modelling to measure plastic leakage into waterways and oceans, from either mismanaged waste or in the form of microplastics. An analysis of the review concludes that there could be stronger convergence between methodologies in this fast-developing area and that plastic footprint methodologies are lacking in several ways",

To decrease such litter, conducting appropriate control of waste is urgently needed, including through thorough efforts for preventing littering, further enhancement of the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) initiatives involving plastic products, and further development and adoption of plastics with excellent biodegradability and materials alternative to plastics, for e.g., paper. We established Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance consisting of a wide range of business operators that make up the supply chain and work actively in order to accelerate innovation through public-private partnerships by promoting the 3Rs new efforts and alternative materials that make the use of plastic products more sustainable.",

The project aimed at capitalizing on growing a baseline of knowledge on marine plastics sources, pathways and environmental impacts, to recommend actions to build circularity and reduce pollution for the plastic sector. Under this project, a roadmap to circular economy for plastics was developed by UNEP in collaboration with partners. UNEP also developed a report to take stock of the extent of knowledge on plastics in marine environment, a global plastic value chain mapping report and a to-be-published recommendations for action report. 2 multi-stakeholder consultation workshops were held by UNEP to map the plastic value chain and identify recommended actions towards circular economy for plastics. Key elements include: material redesign that makes plastics recyclable from inception; circular product and packaging design; effective and clean technologies and infrastructure to collect, recycle and reduce the current amount of plastics waste; and networks of stakeholders \u2013 governments, policy makers, investors, producers, recyclers and consumers \u2013 to build new models of sustainable consumption and production based on circular reduce-reuse-recycle-based economies.",

The first part is a mapping study that provides insight into the current state of the governance strategies and approaches at the international, regional and sub-regional levels within the context of marine plastic litter and microplastics and identifies gaps. The second part of the assessment extends the discussion on policy gaps and provides policy options. These options include: - Review and revise existing frameworks to address marine plastic litter and microplastics and add a component to coordinate industry; - A new global architecture with a multilayered governance approach This assessment was developed in response to the resolution on Marine Plastic Litter and Microplastic (UNEP/EA.2/Res. 11) adopted by the second session of the UN Environment Assembly",

It is based on a review of national legally-binding instruments that include bans and restrictions, taxes and levies, and waste management measures to enhance disposal, encourage reuse and recycling, and promote alternatives to plastic products. The report includes three sections: 1) plastic bags, 2) other single-use plastics, and 3) microbeads. It seeks to provide a more thorough understanding of the scope and types of regulatory approaches policymakers are employing to address plastic pollution. The report should enable future research by enhancing the understanding of existing legal requirements to prevent plastic pollution at the country level.",

The findings should be used to derive a per capita budget for plastics that defines the maximum ecologically compatible quantity of emissions per person. In addition, methods are being developed to adequately reflect the potential effects of macro- and microplastic emissions in eco-assessments. The project results create a quantitative basis for future political decision-making processes. The PlasticBudget project is therefore divided into two parts: 1) Development of a budget approach that can be used to determine the permissible global total quantities in water bodies and the annual per capita emissions of plastics into the environment. 2) Development of an impact assessment methodology with corresponding environmental indicators in order to consider the plastic waste problem in environmental auditing. Similar to the balance calculation for greenhouse gases in the climate problem, reference variables such as plastic equivalents are developed as a basis for decision-making.",

It focuses on plastic waste from human settlements as a substantial share of marine litter consists of plastics stemming from land-based sources. A methodological approach is elaborated to assess plastic waste leakage in qualitative and quantitative terms, enabling deeper understanding of these characteristically chaotic plastic waste flows. | 10 KEY MESSAGES FOR PREVENTING MARINE LITTER 1. Promote integrated sustainable waste management 2. Respect the waste hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle as much as possible 3. Drastically expand waste collection coverage, efficiency and the separation of plastics 4. Enhance awareness raising and cleaning activities of streets, canals and beaches 5. Build sound institutions, policies, operator models and cost-recovery mechanisms 6. Implement extended producer responsibility schemes and deposit-refund systems 7. Promote reusable packaging and product design for recycling 8. Enable cooperation of stakeholders across sectors from source to sea 9. Facilitate the exchange of local decision-makers across borders 10. Strengthen dialogue along plastic and packaging value chains",

Its objective is to allow municipalities, NGOs and governments to map the flow over time of macro-sized plastic waste items throughout their region, from the point of generation to their eventual disposal or fate in the environment .By answering a series of questions on the local socio-economic, environmental and technical conditions, particularly regarding the details of waste and resources management techniques and infrastructure, the calculator is able to identify mechanisms by which plastic items may become mismanaged and subsequently transported to waterways based on each items physical properties . As the flow of mass is mapped throughout the waste management system, this allows the quantification of plastic pollution sources and identification of prioritised interventions .The tool is applied at a district (neighbourhood) level, however results can be combined to analyse waste flows over larger regions or on a watershed level . Two levels of assessment, broad and detailed, allow greater flexibility based on local requirements and resources.",

This will be achieved through the development of an Action Plan to strengthen the local industry for the manufacturing of alternatives (including, but not limited to bioplastics), and building up capacities for plastics recycling. The proposed project has the potential to reduce plastic leakage to the environment and unlock new economic opportunities - both of which are urgently needed for South Africa. The project would consist of two components: one will support the identification and implementation of opportunities for sustainable alternative materials, including bioplastics, and the second will support the implementation of the Industry Waste Management Plan of the plastic packaging industry by building up the capacity and integration of the informal waste sector; with a view to enhance waste separation at source to increase the quality and amount of collected recyclables.",

        "summary": "Measures against marine litter require quantitative data for the assessment of litter abundance, trends and distribution. While beach litter monitoring has been ongoing in some European areas since years, so far it was yet not possible to obtain an overview and to analyse litter abundance, litter category distribution and trends at the different spatial scales from local to EU. Therefore, the EU Marine Directors and the Marine Strategy Coordination Group mandated, in the context of the MSFD implementation, to the MSFD Technical Group on Marine Litter and the JRC, the compilation and analysis of an EU beach litter dataset. Aim was to derive EU Marine Beach Litter Baselines at different spatial levels. After collection of European beach litter data from EU Member States via the EMODNET chemistry module database, harmonisation of data formats and data clean-up, a 2012-2016 dataset was derived. Following the spatio-temporal aggregation of data. The application of agreed scenario parameters has enabled the calculation of marine beach litter baselines for the years 2015 and 2016 at spatial scales ranging from country and country \u2013region level to sub-regional, regional and EU level. Litter categories have been aggregated and allow analysis of group categories up to EU level, whereas the analysis of single categories could not include all received data due to non-comparable litter type category descriptions. and the identification of possible litter category analysis, different scenarios for baseline setting have been tested and evaluated. The resulting set of baselines enables the future monitoring of progress in reduction, as well as compliance checking developed using the dataset. Furthermore, it provides valuable information for future improving harmonised monitoring through updated guidance, common data treatment and agreed data reporting formats. Beach litter abundance has been found to be very high in large areas of Europe, requiring joint and strong action in Europe and with the neighbours in shared marine basins.",
